  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The reason of the anonymity of this book is obvious.
Revealing as it does the actual state of affairs in
the Balkan Peninsula in this present year of grace 1907,
it contains many plain truths and much outspoken criticism.</p>

<p class='c001'>By a long journey of close, confidential inquiry through
Montenegro, Northern Albania, Dalmatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina,
Servia, Bulgaria, Roumania, Turkey, and Macedonia, I have,
at risk of betraying certain information imparted to me under
seal of secrecy, endeavoured to place the actual and serious
truth before English readers, and thus render complicated
questions, such as Bulgaria and the Exarchate, more intelligible
than heretofore.</p>

<p class='c001'>Private audiences were granted me by the various kings
and princes of the Balkan States, and by His Imperial Majesty
the Sultan, as well as by almost each member of the various
Cabinets in turn, so that I was enabled to gather information,
some of which is, of course, known in the chancelleries
of Europe, while other facts will probably come as a revelation,
even to Balkan diplomats themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>What I was told in one country was often contradicted
in the next. Yet, possessing many “friends at Court,” I
was afforded unique facilities for studying, in each country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the various questions on the spot. My inspection of the
Servian prisons, in company with the Minister of Justice,
was, for instance, the first occasion upon which a foreigner
has been allowed to study the penal system in that country;
while I am, I believe, the only Englishman to visit and be
the guest of those wild brigandish tribes of Northern Albania.</p>

<p class='c001'>The secret aims and aspirations of the various Balkan
States herein explained are based upon actual information
gathered from confidential and reliable sources. The exposure
of the shameful German and Austrian intrigues is
no mere idle denunciation, but are actual facts, as revealed
to me by certain Cabinet Ministers and other persons equally
responsible, and supported by documentary evidence which
I have had through my own hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards that land of terror, fire, and sword, Macedonia,
I can only say that I have spared the reader many horrifying
details and photographs of what I saw there with my own
eyes. The blood of those poor defenceless women and children
who are daily slaughtered by Greek bands cries aloud to
Europe for vengeance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Will there be war between Bulgaria and Turkey during
the present year?</p>

<p class='c001'>To arrive at a definite conclusion upon that very serious
point was one of the chief objects of my inquiry, and this
record of its result—injudicious though I may be in putting
it in print—will probably be read with interest by many to
whom the Near East, with its mysteries, its constant plots,
and its tangled politics, is as a closed book.</p>

<p class='c001'>All through the Balkan Peninsula the weak are to-day
being crushed by the strong. The Austrian Eagle has overshadowed
and grasped Bosnia, she has her talons into Servia,
and is casting covetous glances upon gallant little Montenegro.
On the other hand, as part of the secret policy of Christian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Germany in her advance southward, the poor defenceless
Macedonians are being daily outraged, murdered, or burned
alive—the true facts being always suppressed and the news
scarcely ever being allowed to leak out—while the Kaiser
every day lifts his eyes to Heaven, implores the Divine aid,
and consigns the destinies of his Empire to the direction of
the Almighty!</p>

<p class='c001'>To Germany, in great measure, is the present terrible
state of Macedonia due. Her diplomacy at the Sublime
Porte has recently exposed, beyond all doubt, that she secretly
aids Greece and abets the Greek bands in their nefarious
work of outrage, murder, and extermination.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Kaiser could, by simply lifting his hand, stem the
blood-lust of those armed hordes, and bring peace and security
to the Macedonian population. But his secret policy is to create
disorder in that terror-stricken country, so that Bulgaria
and Turkey must be compelled, ere long, to fly at each other’s
throats.</p>

<p class='c001'>Therefore he closes his Imperial eyes to those scenes of
wanton slaughter that daily are a disgrace to our civilisation
in this twentieth century, and matters are rapidly going
from bad to worse.</p>

me. I wanted to see the Balkans as they really are, those
great, wild, mountainous countries, so full of race hatreds,
of political bickerings, of fierce blood-feuds, of feverish propagandas—those
nations with their interesting monarchs and
their many mysteries.</p>

<p class='c001'>The “Orient” runs direct from Paris to the Balkan capitals,
it is true, but if one goes to study a people the capital is
not the only place in which to discover the truth. One must
go into the country, move among the peasantry, hear their
grievances and investigate their wrongs. Therefore I decided
to enter the East by Montenegro, and also visit the wild and
little-known regions of Northern Albania.</p>

<p class='c001'>The comfortable voyage by the Austrian-Lloyd mail steamer
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Graf Wurmbrand</i></span> from Trieste down the Adriatic, touching
at Pola, the Austrian naval station, Lussinpiccolo, Zara—famed
for its maraschino—Sebenico, Spalato, and Gravosa
to Cattaro, has been already described by many writers. Suffice
it to say that it is perhaps one of the most picturesque of
pleasure-trips in the world, for every moment one has a fresh
panorama of mountain and blue sea, of green, fertile islands
with subtropical vegetation, and tiny white villages nestling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>at the sea’s edge, as the steamer threads her way through
the narrow and often difficult channels.</p>

<p class='c001'>At times the wild scenery, especially in the Bocche di
Cattaro, reminds the traveller of the Norwegian fiords, and
at others the coast is an almost exact reproduction of the
French Riviera.</p>

<p class='c001'>The object of my journey was, however, not in order to
write a mere description of men and places. There have
been other travellers in the Balkans who have related their
story, therefore my mission was to make careful inquiry into
the present unsettled state of affairs, try and discover the
grievances of both sides, and endeavour to obtain from the
rulers and statesmen of the various nations their aspirations
for the future. This I succeeded in doing, for the various
monarchs of the Balkans graciously gave me audience;
and from their Ministers, from the middle classes, and from
the peasants, I was enabled at last to form some conclusion
as to the real situation—political, economical, social, and
financial.</p>

<p class='c001'>The writer who attempts to place the various Balkan
questions impartially and clearly before the public will at
once find himself utterly confused, and wallowing wildly
in a morass of misstatement and misrepresentation. The
Balkans are torn by race hatreds, party strife, and the intrigues
of the Powers. The Turk hates the Bulgar, the Serb hates
the Austrian, the Roumanian hates the Greek, the Albanian
hates the Montenegrin, the Bosnian hates the Turk, while
the Macedonian hates everybody all round. What is told to
one authoritatively one hour, is flatly contradicted the next;
therefore it is not in the least surprising that in the European
Press there have been so many misstatements about the
various Balkan questions, the real truth being so very difficult
to obtain.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have, however, endeavoured to obtain it, and at risk of
being injudicious, to place before the reader the facts as they
are, without any political bias, or any seeking to gloss over
the many glaring defects of administration of which I have
myself been witness.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>To describe the beauties of the Bocche di Cattaro, that
series of winding channels where the high grey mountains
rise sheer from the water, would be only to traverse old ground.
Suffice it to say that I landed at Cattaro on a bright, sunny
noon, and found upon the quay a tall, lean mountaineer who
had been sent to meet me.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the traveller fresh from the West the Montenegrin
costume of both women and men is very attractive, but a
few days in the Balkans soon accustoms the eye to a perfect
phantasmagoria of colour and of costume. Pero was my
driver’s name, and I noticed that around his waist was a
revolver belt, but minus the weapon. I inquired where it
was, and with a grin he informed me that Cattaro, being in
Dalmatia, the Austrians would not allow Montenegrins to
bring arms into their country; so they were compelled to
leave them on the other side of the frontier, ten kilometres
distant.</p>

<p class='c001'>My bags packed upon the three-horse travelling carriage
and secured with many strings, and Pero equipped with a
plentiful stock of cigarettes, he mounted upon the box, whipped
up his long-tailed ponies, and we started on our eight-hour
ascent of that great wall of mountain that hides Montenegro
from the sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>As we ascended through the little village of Skaljari we
entered upon a magnificent road, said to be one of the greatest
engineering feats of modern times, and steadily ascended,
until at the striped black-and-yellow Austrian boundary post
we crossed the frontier, and were in the “Land of the Black
Mountain”—Montenegro. Across the road, at an acute
angle, a row of paving-stones marks the frontier, and soon afterwards
we found ourselves in the wildest and most desolate
mountain region. At a lonely roadside hut Pero obtained
his big, serviceable-looking revolver, and I, of course, wore
mine in my belt; for in Montenegro or Albania arms make the
man. A man unarmed is looked upon as an effeminate
coward. Indeed, by order of Prince Nicholas every Montenegrin
must wear the national dress, both men and women,
and every man must carry his revolver when out of doors.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Four hours from Cattaro we were in a lonely mountain
fastness, a wild, desolate, treeless region of huge limestone
rocks of peculiar volcanic formation, which gave them the
appearance of a boiling sea. The views over the Adriatic
as we turned back were so superb that, despite photographing
being strictly forbidden on account of the fortresses in the
vicinity, I could not resist the temptation to take one or
two surreptitiously. On, through a bleak, uninhabited country,
we at last reached the guard-house of Kerstac, and then half
an hour later found ourselves upon a plateau where, in the
centre, stood the small clean village of Nyegush, the ancestral
home of the reigning family, and the scene of most of the
Montenegrin wars of independence. Here we halted for
half an hour at the post-house, and before we left, the big,
lumbering post-diligence, with its armed guard, came up
behind us.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before we moved off again it had grown dark, the moon
shone, and for four hours longer we alternately climbed and
descended through that wild region of silence and desolation,
until at last we saw, deep below, the lights of Cettinje, the
little capital, and an hour later brought us to the unpretending
“Grand” Hotel.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hardly had I entered my room when there came a loud
knock at my door, and a tall, scarlet-coated Montenegrin
warrior, armed to the teeth, entered and saluted. For a
moment I looked up at him aghast, but the mystery was
solved when, next second, he handed me with great ceremony
a telegram from a dear friend in England wishing me Godspeed.
I had taken him to be, at least, one of the Prince’s
bodyguard, and he was only a plain telegraph messenger!</p>

<p class='c001'>This was but one of many surprises in store for me in
Montenegro. Next morning I went out to look round the
clean little capital, when, on passing the Prince’s palace, I
saw a number of soldiers drawn up, and as I went by, the
band suddenly struck up the British National Anthem!
I raised my hat, halted, and stood puzzled. Surely they
were not honouring me! Another moment, however, and I
recognised the reason. In a carriage, accompanied by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Grand Marechal of the Court, there drove up my friend
Mr. Charles des Graz, the newly-appointed British Chargé
d’Affaires to Montenegro, who was about to present his credentials
to His Royal Highness the Prince.</p>

<p class='c001'>Montenegro is perhaps the most interesting country in
all the Balkans. Cettinje, a small, clean town of broad streets
and one-storeyed, whitewashed houses, is a little city in the
sky, lying as it does in a cup-shaped depression at the summit
of a high, bare mountain. Its long, straight, main street
reminds one very much of a small country town in England,
if it were not that everyone is, by law, compelled to wear the
national dress, and every man has in his belt his big, long-barrelled
revolver, without which he must never go out of
doors.</p>

<p class='c001'>The men, sturdy mountaineers, are of fine physique—handsome
fellows, all of them. Their dress consists of dark
blue baggy trousers, white woollen gaiters, raw-hide shoes,
a scarlet jacket heavily braided with gold, and a small round
cap, with black silk around the edge and the crown of the
same colour as the jacket, bearing the Prince’s initials in
Servian letters, “H.I.” The women, who are particularly
good-looking, wear dark skirts, beautifully hand-embroidered
blouses, and a kind of long coat, with open sleeves of soft,
dove-grey cloth. Forbidden to wear European hats, they are
compelled to adopt an exactly similar cap to the men, except
that the crown is embroidered instead of bearing the royal
initials.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nowhere have I seen such glorification of the male as in
Montenegro. To the men, born fighters as they are, work is
undignified; therefore the women toil while the opposite
sex look on. I saw women employed in building operations
and performing work which, in other countries, is left to day-labourers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cettinje is quaint in the extreme. The only houses of
foreigners are the various Legations, and the only foreigners
are diplomats with their wives and families. The first thing
that strikes the stranger is the number of petroleum tins.
Opposite the hotel I saw a great ring of empty tins, numbering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>some hundreds, ranged around a fountain. A few women
were squatting gossiping, and an armed policeman lounged
against the water-source. On inquiry, I found that there
was a water famine, and the tins had been placed there at
dawn to await the moment when the authorities thought fit
to allow the people to get their daily supply. The women
had gone away to work, and would return later. The Montenegrins
a short time ago constructed a reservoir, but there
was a crack in it, so the water ran away. Hence the famine.</p>

<p class='c001'>The petroleum tin is never out of sight for a single moment
in Cettinje. At any hour, and in any street, you see women
and children carrying them. They are used for everything,
from milk-pails to flower-pots.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Cettinje one comes for the first time up against the
dark-faced, scowling Albanian in his tightly fitting trousers
of white wool striped with black, his dirty white fez, and the
swagger of superiority in his gait. He is well armed, and for
a good reason. The Montenegrin hates the Albanian, because
of the constant border feuds over at Podgoritza, where blood
is constantly spilt, and where I have seen a Montenegrin in
the market squatting over a basket of apples with a loaded
rifle.</p>

<p class='c001'>That morning I was chatting to a man in Montenegrin
dress, of whom I had bought some excellent cigarettes, manufactured
by the Montenegro Tobacco Monopoly—an Italian
syndicate, by the way—and happened to mention that I was
on my way to Albania.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, gospodin!” he exclaimed, holding up both his hands,
and glancing at the revolver in my belt. “Take my advice.
Don’t go into Albania or Macedonia. You are not safe there
from one moment to the other. For half a word they’ll
shoot you dead as easily as they drink a glass of wine. No
man’s life is worth a moment’s purchase there. I’m Albanian
myself—from Kroja—and I know.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This was scarcely reassuring. I looked about me on
every hand as I strolled through Cettinje. All was so quiet,
so orderly, so very peaceful there, even though the big, burly
mountaineers in the gold-laced jackets eyed me with askance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>as I passed. Not without some trepidation I took a number
of photographs, for I had heard that, like the Turk, the Montenegrin
was averse to having his counterfeit presentment put
upon paper. Nevertheless, the first feeling of insecurity
having passed, I very soon found myself quite at home in
Cettinje, and in the midst of very good and kind friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>A good many foreigners come up from Cattaro to pry
about Cettinje for a day or two, buy picture-postcards and
antique arms, sneer at the honest Montenegrin, and return
into Dalmatia. Towards such, the Montenegrin is not particularly
polite. But those who go to Cettinje to seriously
and thoroughly study the people and their future will find
a great deal of genuine and charming hospitality.</p>

<p class='c001'>My first day in Cettinje was lonely. Afterwards, until
I left, I was always with friends and officials, who took
the greatest trouble to answer my questions and explain
matters.</p>

<p class='c001'>Montenegro is entirely unlike any other country in the
world. Its air of antiquity is particularly pleasing, while
on every hand the beneficent rule of Prince Nicholas is
apparent. Every man in Montenegro swears by his Prince,
whom he almost worships. They call him their “father,”
and if His Royal Highness raised the standard of war tomorrow,
every man would rise and fight to the death. The
Prince is accessible to all his people—more so to them, indeed,
than to the diplomats. Sometimes, early in the morning, he
will sit in an arm-chair on the steps leading to the entrance
of his palace, and there hear the complaints or petitions of
his people. In this patriarchal way he often ministers justice.
Last year he granted Montenegro a Constitution, and there
is now a Skupshtina similar to that of Servia; but the people
have not yet quite understood that in future they must go
to the Ministers, and not to their Prince. They will see him,
and nobody else.</p>

<p class='c001'>In no country is loyalty and patriotism so strong as in
Montenegro. The army is well trained, and the whole country
being one huge natural fortress, a foreign enemy would experience
enormous difficulty in gaining entrance. In Cettinje,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>even a constant traveller like myself meets with continual
surprises. One day, while walking at the rear of the Bigliardo,
or old palace—so called because when built the first billiard
table was introduced—I heard the sound of clanking chains
behind me. At first I took no notice, but as it continued
with regular rhythm I glanced behind, when, to my amazement,
I saw a convict in leg-fetters with difficulty taking his
afternoon stroll beneath the trees! There were several
others on the grass plot before the prison, idling in the shadow
or gossiping with their friends, who had come to keep them
company!</p>

<p class='c001'>Inquiries showed that most of these prisoners were murderers,
not for robbery but for vendetta. In Montenegro the blood-feud
is constant, and life is held very cheap. It invariably
commences by jealousy, and is of everyday occurrence.
Two lovers quarrel, and one is shot. Then the blood-feud
commences, and unlike in Italy or other Southern countries,
the vendetta is not only upon the murderer, but upon his
next-of-kin. Therefore, if the assassin escapes into Servia,
Bosnia, or Turkey, as he so often does, the brother of the
dead man takes up the feud and kills the assassin’s brother
without parley when next he meets him. I myself saw a
man shot dead one night in Ryeka, at the head of the Lake
of Scutari, and the murderer walked coolly away undeterred.
It was the blood-feud, and no one took much notice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“<span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>S’bogom!</i></span>” (God be with you!) It is the expression
you hear on every hand in the Balkans. In the streets the
peasants touch their round caps in salute and exclaim,
“<span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>S’bogom!</i></span>” When you leave for a journey and when you
return, when you rise and when you go to rest; even if you
go for a short walk—it is the same. Life is so uncertain in
those wild regions that the protection of the Almighty is
invoked upon you always, and your revolver is ever ready
in your belt.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Cettinje I had a faithful guide and servant, a black-eyed,
somewhat sinister-looking Albanian, named Palok. He
travelled with me through Montenegro and Albania, and was
most faithful and devoted. Besides Albanian and Serb he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>spoke a little Italian, and possessed a keen sense of
humour.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day, while we were travelling through the wild, bare
mountain, a perfect wilderness of huge boulders without a
single tree or even blade of grass, we halted for our midday
meal, and while eating he told me of a great friend of his
who had recently been killed at Spuz for vendetta, and he
added, fondling the butt of his revolver, “I too, gospodin,
shall die before long.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I looked at him in surprise. His usually humorous face
had changed. It was dark and thoughtful, and his black
eyes were fixed upon me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is there a blood-feud upon you, then?” I asked, in
surprise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” he replied briefly; and though I endeavoured to
persuade him to tell the story, it was not until the following
day that with some reluctance he explained.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A year ago my brother Tef, away in Scutari, fell in
love with a beautiful girl. He had a rival—a young Albanian,
a coppersmith in the bazaar. They quarrelled, but the
girl—ah! she was very beautiful—preferred Tef. Whereupon
the rival one night took his rifle and laid in wait for
my brother in the main street of Scutari. Early in the evening
he left the house of the girl’s father, and as he passed the
fellow shot poor Tef dead.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And he paused as his brow knit deeply, and his teeth
were set tightly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, gospodin. What would you have done had your
own brother died a dog’s death? I took a rifle, and within
a week the murderer was in his grave. I shot him through
the heart—and then I left Scutari.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And you are safe here, in Montenegro?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Safe! Oh dear, no,” he answered. “One day—it may
be to-day—the fellow’s brother will kill me. He must kill
me. It is Fate—why worry about it? It does one no
good.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And the marked man, the man doomed to die at a moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>when he least expects it, rolled a cigarette and lit it with perfect
resignment.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And are you not afraid to go with me back to Scutari?”
I asked, amazed at his fearlessness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Afraid, gospodin!” he exclaimed, looking at me in
reproach as his hand instinctively wandered to his weapon.
“Afraid! No Albanian is afraid of the blood-feud. I have
killed the murderer, and his brother must kill me. It is our
law.” And the doomed man smiled gravely.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the girl?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! They are all the same,” he answered, with a quick
shrug of the shoulders. “A month ago she married a tobacco-seller—a
man old enough to be her father. Poor Tef! If
he could but know!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the blood-feud still continues?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course—until I am dead.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Palok smoked on in silence, entirely resigned to the
fate that awaits him. He knows that one day, as he walks
along the road, the sharp crack of a hidden rifle will sound,
and he will fall to earth, another victim of a woman’s fickleness.</p>

confidential chat—His Royal Highness’s admiration for
England—His views upon Macedonia—He urges me not to attempt to

<p class='c007'>“His Royal Highness the Prince will be pleased to
grant you private audience at four o’clock this afternoon,
gospodin.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The tall, burly aide-de-camp in the little round cap, high
boots, pale blue overcoat, and pistols in his belt, saluted, and
we shook hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was then three o’clock, and I was just about to go out
to visit Madame Constantinovitch, the mother of Princess
Mirko. So I had to return at once to my room and dress for
the audience. The kings and princes of the Balkans have a
habit of summoning one at a moment’s notice, and paying
visits at unearthly hours.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, in Cettinje, in the heart of these wild, desolate fastnesses,
one seems so far removed from European influence,
yet how great a part has this rocky, impregnable country,
with its fierce soldier-inhabitants, played in the politics of
Eastern Europe, and how great a part it is still destined to
play in the near future!</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact that everybody is armed gives the stranger an
uncanny feeling. The man who brings one’s coffee wears
a perfect arsenal of weapons in his sash, and one quickly
acquires the habit of carrying a revolver one’s self. Indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>if you are wise, you will carry a good serviceable weapon
from the moment you enter the Balkans to the moment you
quit them. But if you approach the Albanian frontier, you
will be at once warned not to fire without just cause. A
few shots is sufficient to alarm the whole neighbourhood for
many miles, and on hearing the alarm every man seizes his
rifle and flies to the rendezvous, fully equipped and eager
for the fight with those Albanian border tribes, of whom I
afterwards had the good fortune to be the guest.</p>

<p class='c001'>I had already had a long chat with Prince Danilo, the
Crown Prince of Montenegro, whom I found a very smart
and highly educated man, fully alive to the political difficulties
of the neighbouring states and the necessity of Montenegro
preserving her independence. He held very strong views
upon the terrible state of affairs in Macedonia, and gave me
many interesting details about his own country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having met him, and also his younger brother, Prince
Mirko, I was particularly anxious to make the acquaintance
of their father, Prince Nicholas, the ruler of the sturdy, warlike
dwellers of the “Land of the Black Mountain”—the principal
and most striking figure in this remarkable country, where
peace and war walk ever hand-in-hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since 1860, when his uncle, Prince Danilo, was assassinated,
he has ruled justly, if somewhat sternly, and has succeeded in
raising his nation from a state of semi-civilisation to the high
place it now occupies in the Eastern world. In 1888 he gave
the country a Civil and Criminal Code, and last year he granted
a Constitution. Indeed, he has done all in his power to
induce his warriors to follow the arts of peace without
forgetting those of war.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the hour appointed, the royal aide-de-camp called in
a carriage and drove me to the Palace,—a long, dark brown
building of somewhat plain exterior, as befits the home of a
fighting race,—where I was received in the great hall by
half a dozen bowing servants in scarlet and gold. Here I
was met by the chamberlain, who conducted me up the grand
staircase and into the great audience-chamber, with its many
fine paintings and highly polished floor. Then, after a moment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the Prince—a brilliant figure—entered, shook me by the
hand, and welcomed me to Montenegro.</p>

<p class='c001'>These formalities ended, His Royal Highness said in Italian,
“Come, let us go into yonder room. We shall be able to talk
there more comfortably.” And he led me into a smaller
chamber, where he gave me a seat at the table where he sat.</p>

<p class='c001'>The afternoon was gloomy, and dusk was creeping on,
therefore upon the table a great antique silver candelabra had
been set, and by its light I was enabled to obtain a good
view of the ruler of Crnagora, the “Land of the Black
Mountain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of magnificent physique, tall, muscular, with hair slightly
grey, he bore his sixty-five years lightly. Attired in the
splendid national costume of scarlet, blue, and gold, with
high boots, he wore a single decoration at his throat, the
Cross of Danilo, of which Order he is Master. Upon his handsome,
well-cut features the candles shed a soft light, causing
the gold upon his dress to glitter, and I noticed, as I asked
him questions, how his dark, keen eyes shot quick, inquiring
glances of alertness.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the first few minutes of regal formality His Highness’s
manner entirely changed. Putting ceremony aside, he produced
his cigarette case—of crocodile skin, with the royal
crown and cipher in gold in the corner—offered me a
Montenegrin cigarette, took one himself, lit mine with his own
hand, and then we fell to chatting.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the delightful hour and a half we smoked together I
asked the prince-poet many questions, and learnt many
things. He explained several difficult points in Balkan
politics, which to me, an Englishman, had always been
puzzling. We spoke—in Italian—of Macedonia and of a
certain well-known foreign diplomat in London who was our
mutual friend, the Prince giving me a very kind message to
deliver to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Presently I referred to the splendid result of his rule,
and related to him a little incident which had occurred to me
in Nyegush a few days before, as showing how deeply he was
beloved by his nation. A smile crossed his fine open countenance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>as he replied simply, “I have done my best for my
people—my very best; and I shall do so as long as God gives
me life. I am happy to believe that my people appreciate
my efforts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And now, Monseigneur,” I asked, “will you tell me what
is the present position of Montenegro?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The present position is peace,” was his prompt answer.
“I have granted a Constitution, and the first meeting of the
new Skupshtina has been held successfully. Though the
Albanian question is always with us, I am thankful to say
we are on the most excellent terms with Turkey, while towards
Russia we are pursuing our traditional policy. For the
Emperor Francis Josef of Austria I have nothing but the
most profound admiration, and I owe very much to him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And towards England, Monseigneur?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“England has been, as you know, Montenegro’s very best
friend,” replied the Prince. “I, personally, have the greatest
respect and admiration for your great country. We Montenegrins
always remember that it was Mr. Gladstone who
gave us the strip of seaboard on the Adriatic with Dulcigno.
He was our greatest friend, and his memory is respected by
every man in Montenegro. Of Tennyson, too, I am a great
admirer. I am very fond of his poems.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are a poet yourself, Monseigneur,” I remarked,
remembering that more than one poetical drama from his
pen had been successfully produced on the stage.</p>

<p class='c001'>His Royal Highness smiled, and puffed slowly at his
cigarette.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have written one or two little things, it is true; but
nothing of late.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder if I dare ask your Royal Highness to write a
few lines for me as a souvenir of my visit?” I asked, not
without some trepidation.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah!—well—I won’t promise,” he laughed. “All depends
whether I’m in the mood for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But you will try, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>And the Prince nodded assent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then we spoke of Servia and of recent events there; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>he was not inclined to discuss the question, and naturally so,
when it is remembered that his daughter was the late wife
of King Peter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Returning to the burning question of Macedonia, I saw
that he was well informed of all that was transpiring around
lakes Presba and Ochrida and down in Serres.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a monstrous state of affairs,” he declared. “Something
must be done at once, for as soon as spring comes again
the massacres will increase.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But there are outrages, tortures, and massacres every
day,” I remarked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah yes,” he sighed, “I know. Most terrible details
have reached me lately. But you are going to Macedonia
yourself, and you will see with your own eyes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what, in your opinion, would be the best settlement
of the question?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is but one way, namely, for the Powers to call a
conference and place Macedonia under a governor-general,
who must be a European prince. The reforms would then
be carried out, and the Greek bands expelled from the country.
How long will Europe tolerate the present frightful state of
affairs?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The fact is, Monseigneur, that we, in England, are very
ignorant of the true state of things, or even of the facts of
the Macedonian question,” I said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, there you are quite correct. If your English public
knew what was really happening—how an innocent Christian
population is being slaughtered and exterminated because
of international rivalry—they would cry shame upon those
responsible for this wholesale murder and outrage. But”—he
smiled—“I almost forget myself. My position as a ruler
forbids me to talk politics, you know!”</p>

<p class='c001'>And we laughed together.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So you are going to Servia, Bulgaria, Roumania, and to
Constantinople—eh?” he remarked a little later, when we
had lit fresh cigarettes. “In Bulgaria, and also in Roumania,
you will see many things that will interest you. The Bulgarians
are very strongly armed, and so are the Roumanians.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“Her Majesty the Queen of Roumania has also promised
me audience,” I said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When you see her, will you please present to Her Majesty
my most cordial respects. She is so very charming.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I want, Monseigneur, to visit Northern Albania, leaving
Montenegro by Ryeka and Scutari. Would that be the best
route, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What!” he exclaimed, in surprise. “Do you actually
contemplate visiting the tribes up in the Accursed Mountains?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly. Why not?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, my advice is, don’t think of going there. If you
do, you will never return. You’ll be shot at sight, like a
dog. You have no idea what those uncivilised tribes are
like. The whole country is utterly lawless.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So I understand. But I’ve also heard that the Albanian
possesses a deep sense of honour. And I thought that I might
possibly obtain permission from one or other of the chiefs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Prince was silent for a moment. Then, looking at
me across the table, said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not go. It is far too great a risk.”</p>

<p class='c001'>His advice was the same that my friends in London had
given me; the same that I had received there, in the marketplace
of Cettinje.</p>

<p class='c001'>But I was determined, and pressed His Royal Highness
to assist me, at last receiving his promise of help. By his
kind permission, the Albanian named Palok acted as my guide,
and what eventually happened to me in that wild region will
be seen in the following pages.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well,” exclaimed the Prince at last,“if you go up there,
it must be at your own risk. I’ve warned you of the danger.
No one has been up there for many years. It has been attempted,
of course, but travellers have either been held to
ransom, and the Turks have been compelled to pay for their
release, or else they have simply been shot by the first Albanian
meeting them. The country beyond Scutari is the most
unsafe in the whole Balkan Peninsula.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>I replied that I intended to make the attempt.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, then, I wish you <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>buon viaggio</i></span>,” he laughed. “May
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>every good luck attend you, and—as we say in Montenegro—<span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>S’bogom!</i></span>
(God be with you!) When you return—for I
suppose you will pass this way down to the sea—come and
see me, and tell me all about the Skreli and Kastrati country—for
of course I am highly interested. They are always at
war with our people on the frontier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will let your Royal Highness know the moment I
am back in Cettinje,” I promised.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then rising, he gripped my hand warmly, saying—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I will help you if I can. Be careful of yourself, for
I shall be anxious about you. Again, <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>S’bogom!</i></span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>And the Prince accompanied me to the head of the grand
staircase, where I made my obeisance, turned and descended
through the rows of armed and bowing servants ranged in the
hall, charmed by His Royal Highness’s graciousness towards
me and by the pleasant chat I had enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c001'>When, after my journey through Northern Albania, I one
afternoon re-entered that audience-chamber, and he came
forward with outstretched hand to greet me, he exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, well! I am so glad to see you back safe and sound.
You look a little thinner in the face—a little travel-worn—eh?
Life in the Albanian mountains is not like your life in
London or Paris, is it? But never mind as long as you are
safe,” he laughed, placing his hand kindly upon my shoulder.
“Come along to this room. It is more cosy,” and he led
me to the smaller apartment, his own private cabinet.</p>

<p class='c001'>For nearly two hours I sat relating to him what occurred
on my journey, and describing the wild country which had,
until then, been practically a sealed book. Even though
Cettinje is so near, hardly anything was known of the Skreli,
the Hoti, the Klementi, or the Kastrati tribes, save that they
were brigandish bands who constantly raided the Montenegrin
frontier.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Prince listened to me with great attention, and put
many questions to me as we smoked together.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then rising, he took from a drawer in his great writing-table
a small scarlet box, and as he opened it he bestowed
upon me a compliment undeserved, for he said—</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“There are few men who would have risked what you
have done. Therefore I wish to invest you with our Order of
Danilo, as a mark of my appreciation and esteem.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And he displayed to me the beautiful dark blue and white
enamelled cross of the Order, the same that he was wearing
at his throat, surmounted by the royal crown and suspended
upon the white ribbon edged with cerise.</p>

<p class='c001'>After he had invested me with the Order, saying many
kind things to me, which I really don’t think I deserved, he
added—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chef du chancellerie</i></span> will send you the diploma in
due course, and I trust, when you petition your own gracious
Sovereign King Edward, that His Majesty will allow you to
wear this insignia.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I thanked His Royal Highness, gripped his hand, and a
few minutes later passed through the line of bowing servants
out of the Palace.</p>

<p class='c001'>And that same evening I received from His Royal Highness
the signed photograph which appears in these pages.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before I left Cettinje I received the following expressive
lines, written especially for me by a Montenegrin poet who is
a great personage, but whose name he would not permit me
to give. They are in Servian as follows, and I have placed
their English translation below:—</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>NORTHERN ALBANIA</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER I <br /> INTO A SAVAGE REGION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Wildest Albania—Warnings not to attempt to travel there—I decide to go,
and take Palok—Prince Nicholas of Montenegro bids us farewell—On
the Lake of Scutari—Arrival at Skodra—Passports, rabble, and backsheesh—Photographing
the fortress in secret—Treading dangerous
ground—Albania the Unknown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before leaving London various insurance companies had
flatly declined to accept the risk of “accident,” because
it was known that I intended visiting Albania.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, no company in the City would insure me, and at
Lloyd’s the premium quoted was exorbitant. This was the
reverse of reassuring. Northern Albania I knew to be the
wildest and most savage country in the East, and the Accursed
Mountains, which I wanted to visit, were held by brigandish
tribes, who shot the traveller at sight or held him to ransom.
So little is known about them that they had always held a
peculiar fascination for me.</p>

<p class='c001'>I searched through the journals of the Royal Geographical
Society for many years past, but found little mention of
Northern Albania, while of books of actual travel in that
region there were none. These facts had decided me to accept
the risks, whatever these might be, and go into those wild,
inaccessible mountains which bear the name of Accursed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Everybody warned me of danger. Friends in England
constantly urged me to “take care of myself,” as though
that were possible when in the midst of a hostile tribe; and
in fact there seemed to be a conspiracy on the part of friends,
strangers, and officials to prevent me penetrating the Land
of Mystery.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>When I mentioned my intention in Cettinje, everyone, as I
have already said, held up their hands and raised their eyes.
It was sheer madness, they declared. Nobody’s life was
worth a moment’s purchase outside the town of Skodra—or
Scutari, as it appears on our maps. Outside—beyond
Turkish control—well, I should not be allowed to travel a
couple of miles before I had a bullet through me from behind
a rock at the roadside.</p>

<p class='c001'>Everybody had some weird or horrible story to tell about
the savagery of the Hoti, the Kastrati, the Skreli, and other
savage tribes inhabiting those high, misty mountains beyond
the Montenegro border. The one or two Albanians—tall,
muscular fellows in white felt skullcap, tight white woollen
trousers heavily braided with black, and a kind of black
bolero with long fringe—whom I had seen in Montenegro
were certainly a sinister-looking, forbidding lot. But I had
come to the Balkans to investigate and to learn the truth;
therefore the more I was urged not to attempt to go into
the mountains, the firmer was my determination to do so.</p>

<p class='c001'>His Royal Highness, Prince Nicholas himself, had at one
of the audiences he granted me seriously queried the advisability
of undertaking the journey. Almost daily on the Albanian
frontier were raids into Montenegrin territory, and the whole
border was constantly terrorised by the Albanian bands, who
shot the Montenegrins wherever found. Indeed, the market
at Podgoritza, where men squatted with loaded rifles over four
or five fowls or a basket of apples, was sufficient to tell me the
truth; while the daily talk of that town was of fighting with
the wild race who live across the border. The Montenegrin
hates the Albanian, and has surely good cause to do so. Many
a comely Montenegrin maiden—and some of them are exceedingly
beautiful—has been captured in those night raids
and carried across into Turkish territory, to be heard of no
more. And many, too, are the reprisals by the Montenegrins;
mostly, however, with serious losses to themselves.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Palok, whom I had engaged as my guide, had, he said,
been born in Skodra, or, as we call it, Scutari, which causes it
to be confounded with the city on the Bosphorus. He also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>declared that he was well known there, and the fact that he
also spoke Italian caused me to accept his services.</p>

<p class='c001'>When I asked Fevzi Pasha, the Turkish Minister in Cettinje,
for a passport for Skodra, or “Scutari d’Albanie,” as it appears
on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>visa</i></span>, he granted it, but not without words of caution.
“In Scutari you will have nothing to fear,” he said. “I
will give you a note to the Governor of the town. But do
not go into the country. If you do, you’ll be shot like a dog.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I thanked him, but had no intention of taking his well-meant
advice.</p>

<p class='c001'>At half-past three one dark morning I took Palok, and
we drove out on the road that wound high up across the great
lonely mountains to the little town of Ryeka, whence a small
steamer plies down the Lake of Scutari to Skodra. The drive
was cold and weary, through a barren waste of rocks, but the
bright autumn sun was up ere we reached Ryeka, and just
as I boarded the big canoe with long, upturned, pointed prow,
which takes passengers and baggage down the sluggish stream
to the boat at the entrance to the lake, I saw, on the road
above, a fine military figure in pale blue, riding a splendid white
charger and followed by an officer.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a moment every head was bared. It was Prince
Nicholas, who was staying at his palace at Ryeka, taking his
morning ride.</p>

<p class='c001'>He espied me, pulled up, and shouted down in Italian—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hulloa! Good-morning! Then you are off to Albania
after all, eh?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, Monseigneur,” I responded.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did you get my message last night?” he inquired, referring
to a confidential matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank you, Monseigneur, yes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very well. Only be careful of yourself, you know, and
when you get back, come and tell me all about it.” And,
laughing, His Royal Highness waved his hand with a merry
“Bon voyage!” and cantered away, while my half a dozen
fellow-travellers in gold-braided costumes regarded me in
wonder that their Prince should stop and converse with
me—a perfect stranger.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Down the silent river, between steep green hills we glided.
Choked by the tangle and rot of weeds, it was the haunt of
thousands of waterfowl, and, as we passed, the herons rose with
a lazy flapping of wings,—a stream that might well be haunted
by the fairies, for the water was unruffled and the silence deep
and complete.</p>

<p class='c001'>Boarding the little steamer, the <i>Nettuno</i>, lying at the
mouth of the river, we were soon out in the great green lake,
with the high mountains looming grey in the far distance.
As we steamed due south, the barren mountains of Montenegro
were soon left behind. At Virpasar and Plavnitza we picked up
passengers, a fat Turkish peasant woman carrying two baskets
of fowls, and three young Montenegrins, fully armed with
rifles and revolvers. Because she was not yet in Turkey, the
woman wore no veil; yet in the evening, as soon as Skodra
came in sight, she produced her veil, and carefully adjusted
it, laughing with me the whole time, and wound it until
only her bright dark eyes were visible.</p>

<p class='c001'>From Virpasar an Italian company is now building a
railway to the Montenegrin port of Antivari, so that in a
couple of years the lake will be connected with the Adriatic,
and form the much-needed trade route for Montenegro. The
Servians, indeed, are hoping also to use Antivari as their
Adriatic port, and thus be free of the excessive Customs dues
and other oppression placed upon them by Austria-Hungary.
When in Belgrade, M. Stoyanovitch, the Servian Minister of
Commerce, explained to me the several schemes for the construction
of a railroad from Krushevatz, in Servia, by way
of Novi-Bazar, Ipek, Podgoritza, and Ryeka, to join the
Italian line at Virpasar, and so to the Adriatic or to San
Giovanni di Medua. Servia must secure a port, and this line,
whenever made, will be a most paying concern, for by its
extension from Stalacs—on the main Belgrade-Sofia line—to
Orsova, it would receive most of the exports of Southern
Russia to Western Europe.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>Palok</span>, my companion through the Skreli country.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The mere handful of lake-side dwellings which now constitutes
Virpasar will, ere many years have passed, grow into
an important trade centre, and upon the great silent lake,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>surrounded by those high sheer mountains where the eagle
and the pelican are now the only signs of life, big passenger and
freight steamers will soon ply. The railway, which must be
built ere long, will quickly bring a civilising influence upon
Northern Albania; therefore, if one wishes to see it in all its
wildness, it must be seen to-day. In another decade the
Albanian brigand—the real thing out of the story-book—will
be only a matter of history.</p>

<p class='c001'>The calm, bright day was perfect. The surface of the
great lake was like a mirror, and the fringe of giant mountain
constantly changed in colour—grey, blue, purple, and rose—as
the hours wore on, and the sun sank westward in all the
crimson glory of the death of the autumn day.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now and then, with our rifles, we took pot-shots at the
pelicans, but with little result. A young Montenegrin killed
one, and the huge bird came down with a great splash into
the water. At last, in the falling twilight, we cast anchor
at the head of the Boyana River, which empties itself into the
lake, and then, boarding another high-prowed canoe, where
a Turkish soldier sat over us with a loaded rifle, we were
rowed slowly up to the low line of ramshackle buildings,
which was our first sight of Skodra.</p>

<p class='c001'>With our farewell to the <i>Nettuno</i> we had said good-bye to
civilisation, as represented by sturdy Montenegro. We were
in Albania, the wildest and most turbulent country in the
East.</p>

<p class='c001'>We landed upon some slimy steps amid a perfect babel of
shouts. Hundreds of unwashed Turks and Albanians were
awaiting us, all shouting in a language of which I understood
not one word. Every man, armed and of ferocious aspect,
seemed ready to make short work of both Palok and myself.
Indeed, so unpleasant is the landing at Skodra, that Palok
himself had already sent a message to a friend of his—a typical
brigand of the first water—to give the Customs officer a tip,
and so make pleasant our path through that dark, evil-smelling
hole where the Turks collect their dues. Palok’s friend,
whom I only saw on that one occasion, and whose name I
could not ascertain, had managed to secure from somewhere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>a mustard-coloured ramshackle fly, the upholstering of which
was in ribbons. The driver, in his white fez, with dirty white
baggy trousers and yellow tunic, came forward and saluted
me with deep obeisance, while I was explaining to the passport
officer—a ragged, consumptive youth—that my name was not
“We, Sir Edward Grey.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The chief of the Customs was a long, very thin, white-fezzed
Turk with large silver-mounted pistols in his belt,
very tight white trousers, a gold-embroidered jacket, and
pointed slippers that turned up at the toes in the most approved
style. He was a real live Bey, so Palok told me, but he was
not averse to receiving tenpence as a tip. Later, when I left
Scutari (or Skodra) again, I gave him ten Austrian crowns, for
I had in my bag a couple of thousand cigarettes, which, by
Turkish law, are prohibited from leaving the country. His
charge for winking at the contravention is five crowns a
thousand!</p>

<p class='c001'>Turkish Custom Houses are weird places, and it is no
wonder that the British Ambassador at Constantinople is just
now pressing for some reform. Your belongings are not only
thoroughly examined and heavily assessed for Customs—if you
won’t tip—when you enter Turkish territory, but the same
happens when you leave. Woe-betide those who dispense
with the services of a discreet dragoman and do not tip. All
that you may have bought in Turkey will be found liable to
duty. Gold embroideries will be weighed, and anything that
has the Sultan’s monogram upon it—as so many embroideries
have—will be at once confiscated.</p>

<p class='c001'>The man in the fez is grave and inexorable. His attitude
is as though he would scorn the offer of a bribe and throw
you into prison for daring to insult an official of His Imperial
Majesty. Yet outside the Custom House he keeps a crafty
ragamuffin who is ready to accept a four-franc piece on his
behalf, and for that he will pass a thousand pounds’ worth
of goods with only a pretence of search! The Custom House
at Galata on the Bosphorus is a case in point. There are
five officials there who share the spoils from the traveller.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, the land of the Crescent is indeed a quaint country.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The corruption of Turkish Customs officials is no doubt due
to the frequent non-payment of their stipends. They must
live, and do so by accepting bribes. I afterwards spoke to
certain high government officials at Constantinople about it,
and they admitted that they knew bribery existed extensively,
but at present were utterly unable to suppress it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Over the ramshackle Custom House, a dark hole without a
window, frowns a shattered fortress containing one or two
antiquated guns, a photograph of which I afterwards obtained
surreptitiously, and which appears in these pages. Had I
been discovered, I might have spent an unpleasant year or
so in a Turkish prison. But even that offence, so heinous in
Germany, France, or Austria, I suppose I could easily have
expiated with a few piastres of backsheesh. In Turkey you
can do anything—if you are prepared to pay.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon that filthy crowd around the Custom House at Skodra,
upon those crumbling buildings, upon that old white fortress,
upon the tower of Skodra itself, a mile away, the centuries
of progress have made no impression. Here is the country
of a mediæval people, the life of an age long ago past and
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c001'>While our fellow-travellers were squabbling, arguing,
shouting, and cursing the wild, dirty mob who now filled
the Custom House, we, with our baggage—canvas bags,
specially made to sling on mules for mountain travelling—ascended
into the mustard-coloured conveyance and were
driven along a country lane, very English in its appearance,
with bramble hedgerows and ditches; yet the high, thin minaret
of a mosque before us, and the carefully latticed windows
of a house, preventing the women-folk from being seen from
the roadway, and giving the place an air of mystery, showed
us to be in the land of His Majesty the Sultan—in Albania the
Unknown.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Fired at in the street of Skodra—My comfortless inn—Panorama of life—Armed
bands of wild mountaineers in the streets—The Sign of the
Cross—Scutarine people—The fascination of Skodra—In the den of
my friend Salko—Making purchases—Short shrift with swindlers—Some
genuine antiques—Ragged and shoeless soldiers of the Sultan—Men
shot in the blood-feud—“It is nothing!”</p>

<p class='c007'>I had not been in Skodra half an hour before a man fired
at me with his revolver.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was my welcome to Albania, and I confess that I drew
my own weapon from my belt, prepared to defend myself.</p>

<p class='c001'>I had arrived at the <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>han</i></span>, or inn, a poor place dignified by
the name of Hôtel de l’Europe, washed, and descended to the
street, when, on emerging from the doorway, somebody fired
his pistol right in my face. The flash startled me, and in an
instant I was on my guard with my back to the wall. In that
brief second all that I had heard of the insecurity of Albania
flashed back.</p>

<p class='c001'>My assailant—a tall, ragged-looking, middle-aged Turk in
a scarlet fez—laughed in my face and uttered some words that
I did not understand. He saw my weapon shining in the
dim light, and pushed it away with a laugh. His manner
struck me as friendly, so I dropped my arm; whereupon
another man, in passing, also fired, then another and another,
until, ten seconds later, everybody in the street was firing
indiscriminately, and bullets were flying in all directions.</p>

<div id='i048'  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>In Skodra.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I held my breath. Had the place actually revolted against
the Turk just at the moment of my arrival? If so, I was in
luck’s way. I knew that the Albanian hated the Turk, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Palok had told me that the revolution was only a question
of time, and that one day his people would drive them out
of Skodra. The place was once Servian, and captured by
the Turks in 1479. Yet the Albanian still looks upon the
Turk as a miserable intruder, and intends one day, ere long,
to drive him out.</p>

<p class='c001'>Around me, on every hand, pistols were being fired, the
flashes showing red in the night, and I stood breathless,
wondering what was happening. The man who had fired
in my face was grinning at my alarm, when Palok dashed out
to me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Signore! Signore!” he cried, in Italian. “It is
nothing! Don’t be alarmed. It is only the vigil of the fast
of Ramadan. It is our way of celebrating it!”</p>

<p class='c001'>By that time every man in the whole town was firing off
his revolver. The din was deafening.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very well,” I laughed. “Then I’ll celebrate it too,”
and, raising my arm, I also emptied my weapon in the air.</p>

<p class='c001'>The grinning Turk who had first fired and alarmed me
saluted me by touching chin and forehead, and then we laughed
together. It was certainly fortunate for him and for myself
that I had not let fly, but he did not seem to heed at all the
danger of firing suddenly upon a foreigner ignorant of what
was about to happen.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>han</i></span>, with the dignified name of “hotel,” was certainly
an uncomfortable place. Cold roast pork, a trifle “high,” was
all I could get to eat, and this was washed down by a light
red vinegar, which was probably at one time wine. For five
days running I had that very same pork served twice a day,
until I sent Palok into the bazaar to buy me other supplies.
A narrow camp bed, an iron washstand with tin fittings,
a pail and a deal table, comprised my furniture, the best
accommodation that Skodra could afford.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet the town is perhaps one of the most interesting in
all the Balkans, and its people the most strangely mixed
and wearing a greater variety of Eastern costume than even
in Constantinople itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bazaar, down by the river, is full of quaint types
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and most interesting. Its uneven pavement is quite as unclean
and slippery with the dirt of ages as are the streets
of Constantinople, but its dark little sheds are filled by workers,
silver and copper smiths, embroiderers, armourers, weavers,
jewellers—in fact, one sees every trade being carried on in
the same primitive way and with the same tools as in the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c001'>Skodra is not a town of progress, for there telephone or
electric light is forbidden; machinery of every kind is against
the law, and neither newspapers nor books are allowed to
enter Albania. Therefore in those crooked streets of the
bazaar the traveller is back in mediæval days, and the town
of to-day is just as Florence was in the days of Boccaccio or
Dante. Like the mediæval Florentines, many of the men
from the mountains shave their heads, leaving a tuft of bushy
hair at the back, which is cut square at the neck. With their
tight-fitting black-and-white striped trousers, black woollen
boleros, their belts filled with cartridges, and a rifle over their
shoulders, they are a fine, manly race, with swaggering gait,
clean-cut features—mostly Catholics, who spit openly at the
lean, ragged, ill-fed soldiers of the Sultan.</p>

<p class='c001'>They come down from the mountains in armed bands,
and walk through the town, a dozen or so together, in complete
defiance of the Turk. With men upon whose heads
a price has been set—known brigands or murderers, indeed—I
have chatted and drunk coffee in the bazaar, all wild fellows
who know no law except their own, and who do not acknowledge
the Turk as their ruler. When I inquired of Palok
the reason of their immunity from arrest, he replied—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, signore, if the Turks captured one of these, the
whole of Northern Albania would rise as one man. The
tribes would sweep down from the mountains and sack and
burn Skodra within twenty-four hours. Life in this town is
very uncertain, I can tell you. One never knows when the
rising will take place. All is ripe for it, and when it comes,
then woe-betide the Turk and all the Moslems. Have you
not noticed the Sign of the Cross over the doors of the Christians?
Is that not significant?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The Albanian tribesmen are mostly Catholics, together
with some Orthodox; yet they combine religion strangely
with war. They go to the Catholic Cathedral in Skodra
with loaded rifles, which they place before them as they kneel
and pray, and before murdering their enemy they will go
and ask Providence to assist them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The town Christian of Skodra is, for the most part, a
very excellent fellow. Palok, whom I found was well known,
introduced me to many of them, and in that wild land I received
very many charming kindnesses from perfect strangers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The costume of the Scutarine men is distinctly quaint
and curious. A short dark red jacket, the front and sleeves
of which are so completely braided with narrow black braid
as to almost hide the foundation, and edged with dozens of
oblong brass buttons; a pair of wide, dark blue baggy breeches
reaching to the knee; a round flat fez with a huge blue silk
tassel that falls about the shoulders; a bright, striped silk
sash; their legs in white cotton stockings and feet in patent
leather dress-shoes. Such is the dress of the average Christian
one meets in Skodra.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attire of the women is even more extraordinary.
They veil, just as do the Mohammedan women, and only
uncover their faces when they go to church. For the most
part they are beautiful when young, with clear, delicate complexions,
handsome features, and dancing black eyes; but
after seventeen appear to soon lose their beauty and become
prematurely wrinkled and old. The outdoor dress is generally
made of the same dark red cloth as the men’s jackets, so
completely embroidered as to appear black. Indeed no
Scutarine, either man or woman, goes out in a dress unless it
is covered with embroidery. In every street you will see a
dozen men squatting cross-legged in a little dark shop, busily
plying the needle upon the narrow black braid, and applying
tiny pieces of green cloth among the braid as additional
ornament. Often the braiding is a marvel of needlework
and design, and some of the outdoor costumes of the women,
though exceedingly ugly, are ornamented in such a manner
as to amaze the Western eye.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Female outdoor attire is, of course, of the divided skirt
order, trousers of thick braided cloth so clumsy that the
wearer can only walk with difficulty, a long cape, richly
embroidered on the shoulders and reaching to the hips, with
a square kind of sailor collar that is raised and pinned to the
crown of the head. From the bridge of the nose to the knee
falls the white veil, like the Moslem women, while from the
sash are pinned gaily coloured silk handkerchiefs, which,
appearing below the cape, lend additional colour to the most
unwieldy and ugly of all the dresses of the East. The wearer
cannot walk, but can only waddle with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c001'>The streets of Skodra are, however, a perfect panorama
of costume. In the dark entries the shuffling Mohammedan
women, white-clothed from head to foot and veiled, look
ghostly and mysterious; the Mohammedan unmarried girls
with the striped red-and-white veil wrapped about them;
Albanians from the south in short, stiff cotton skirts like
exaggerated kilts; Turks in greasy frock-coats and discoloured
fezes, strolling slowly, fingering their beads to pass the time
through Ramadan; fierce tribesmen from the mountains in all
sorts of different costumes, fully armed and ready to shoot
in an instant at discovering an enemy even there in the
crowded bazaar; unveiled country women in short, coarse,
black homespun skirts, wearing great iron-studded belts and
savage ornaments in brass, copper, and gold; giggling girls
from the mountains four or five days distant, dressed in their
gorgeous gala dresses, laughing as they bargain with the
voluble keepers of the tiny shops in the bazaar.</p>

<p class='c001'>Skodra fascinates one. There is no European influence
here: not a soul is in European dress. It is the unchanging
East—the same life that has existed here for centuries. The
Turks are, however, fanatics, and Palok will not allow me
to smoke a cigarette in the street in the daytime, for in the
fast of Ramadan the Mohammedans abstain from all food,
drink, and tobacco from four in the morning till the gun fires
on the fortress at sunset.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon Palok’s advice I even wore a fez, so as not to be
too conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>When I asked the reason, he simply grinned, shrugged his
shoulders, and said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The signore believes Skodra to be a safe place. But it
is not always so. Why run unnecessary risk? And a fez is
very comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So after buying a fez, I took it to the ironer, a white-bearded
old Turk, who pressed it and shrunk it and combed out
its tassel with great ceremony, and then I assumed the distinctive
mark of the Sultan’s subjects, evidently to the great
relief of the faithful Palok.</p>

<p class='c001'>On our first visit to the bazaar Palok discovered a friend.
He was a very tall, thin-legged Albanian, in a white fez, a
white woollen bolero, and the usual black-and-white woollen
trousers and turned-up shoes of raw-hide and interlaced
string. In one of the narrow, tortuous ways of the bazaar,
on a kind of platform before a small ramshackle booth,
where rope and twine were displayed, he was squatting cross-legged,
staring into space and awaiting customers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Suddenly espying Palok, he seized his slippers, which
stood near him, and sprang out upon the filthy pavement.
Next second the pair were clasped in embrace, and after
many mutual words of warm welcome in Albanian, I was
introduced.</p>

<p class='c001'>The seller of string looked me up and down critically until
his eye caught my revolver in my belt, and then, apparently
satisfied with my appearance, he touched his chin and brow
in salutation.</p>

<p class='c001'>We ascended to the little platform, and a box was brought
for me to sit upon. A shout into the narrow alley brought
me a cup of Turkish coffee.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is my friend, Salko,” Palok explained, in Italian,
after the pair had been apparently discussing me. “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Mio buon
amico.</i></span> One of the best men in the bazaar. For eight years
we have been parted, and how pleased I am to see him again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Salko interrupted, whereupon Palok said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“My friend apologises, signore, that he cannot take coffee
with you, or offer you a cigarette. It is Ramadan, you know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I offered Salko my case, and, taking a cigarette, he placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>it aside until after sunset, touching his chin and brow and
laughing merrily.</p>

<p class='c001'>I wanted to buy several things in the bazaar—a piece or
two of old silver, if I could find it—and some antique embroideries
which Palok had told me I could find. He told
Salko this, whereupon he shouted outside to a passer-by, and
in a moment the news was all over the bazaar, and all sorts
and conditions of men appeared with various things for sale:
beautiful silver-mounted and gem-studded pistols and swords,
old silver ornaments, embroideries of the sixteenth century,
genuine antiques of all sorts, old jewellery—in fact, in a
quarter of an hour Salko’s little shed-like shop presented the
appearance of that of an antique dealer.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two gorgeous Turkish ladies’ costumes attracted me.
The trousers were of silk, and interwoven with real gold and
silver thread; the boleros of rich crimson velvet, wonderfully
embroidered with gold; the sashes gay; and the little fezes,
with golden sequins, smart and coquettish. They were the
real thing, and could be worn at a fancy-dress ball in England
with certain success.</p>

<p class='c001'>I liked them, for they were the genuine thing. Dresses
such as they were are not made nowadays. Turkish ladies of
to-day prefer the lighter stuffs of the Franks, silks from Paris,
and figured gauzes from Germany. Those dresses had once
graced the harem of some great Pasha—perhaps, indeed, that of
the Sultan himself. So I allowed Salko to bargain for them.</p>

<p class='c001'>I watched, and was amused.</p>

<p class='c001'>The man who had them to sell apparently asked a price
that was exorbitant, whereupon my friend, with a wave of
his hand, ordered him to pack them back in the bundle.</p>

<p class='c001'>High words followed, and I expected every moment the
pair would come to blows. The vendor was a round, fat-faced
eunuch, with an ugly scar across his brown cheek. And
while the controversy was in progress, the others who had
wares to offer squatted about and advised each side as to how
much the costumes were really worth. Then at last both
sides got at loggerheads, hard words were used and insulting
gestures; fists were shaken, and angry scowls exchanged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>until I momentarily expected that there would be a free
fight and bloodshed.</p>

<p class='c001'>One man I noticed who had not spoken was fingering the
hilt of his knife, as though itching to join in the fray.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m going out of this,” I told Palok, whereupon he only
laughed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There’s really nothing to fear, signore. It is always so.
They ask double, and Salko is teaching the fellow manners.
You are a foreigner, and you don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I admitted that I did not.</p>

<p class='c001'>The argument continued, and in the end the fat-faced
eunuch was bundled out by Salko into the dirty alley and his
goods thrown after him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nobody smiled. Such treatment seemed usual, and on
the following day I bought the dresses.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next was a little old Turk with a long white beard,
who had an old silver ornament for sale, one of those triangular
boxes which women wear round their necks containing
scraps of the Koran, supposed to protect them from the
influence of the Evil Eye.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though he came meek and humble, Salko glared at him.
No. The Englishman was his guest, and he would see that
only what was just was paid. He took the ornament from
me, and weighing it in his hand, judged its worth. Two
other men agreed, and the old man, without being consulted,
was handed the money and told to be gone.</p>

<p class='c001'>Assuredly business methods are quaint in the town we
Europeans call Scutari.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another after another—shopkeepers, all of them in the
same category as Salko himself—was interviewed. Those who
offered rubbish were promptly ordered out. And so, before me,
seated upon my box, was unfolded the treasures of the bazaar.</p>

<p class='c001'>And assuredly some of the curios offered were fit to grace
any museum. Seldom does a foreigner visit Skodra, therefore
it still contains many real antiques; and there being no sale
for them, prices are not exorbitant. It is, indeed, one of the
few places left where one can obtain anything worth having.</p>

<p class='c001'>A long, lean Christian, in his flat round fez and enormous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>tassel, offered me nine early Greek gold coins that had only
a week before been discovered in a tomb. I doubted the
tomb part of the story, but I was afterwards shown it half a
mile away, and could also have bought the actual vase in
which they had been found. I am not a collector of coins,
so I declined them. One day, however, those coins will, no
doubt, find their way into one of our European national
collections, for they were so perfect that they looked as though
just fresh from the matrix.</p>

<p class='c001'>I was turning over in my hand a number of antique gem
rings, when of a sudden, just outside, not a dozen yards from
where I sat, there was a loud shout, followed by a pistol-shot.
Then more shouting, and a little crowd gathered. In alarm
I sprang to my feet, and I saw outside a mountaineer, in white
felt skullcap, lying in a pool of blood with part of his face
blown away.</p>

<p class='c001'>A man in black-and-white trousers stalked past, flourishing
his big pistol and threatening to shoot anybody who dared
to stop him. He was the assassin.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is nothing, signore,” Palok declared, reseating himself.
“Only the blood-feud. The men were <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>in sangue</i></span>, and have
met. In such cases one must always die. The man who
shoots first gets the best of it,” and he grinned.</p>

<p class='c001'>For fully five minutes the man lay in the filthy gutter
without a hand being placed upon him to see if life were
extinct. Then it occurred to somebody to see. He was
pronounced dead, and a couple of men carried away the corpse.
No police or guard put in an appearance, and the life of the
bazaar went on as though nothing unusual had happened.</p>

<p class='c001'>But nothing unusual had happened. Such assassinations
occur every day, and nobody takes any heed of them. The
blood-feud is part of the Albanian creed, both Mohammedan
and Christian.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not, however, pleasant to have a man shot dead
before one’s eyes, nor does it tend to inspire confidence in
one’s own personal safety.</p>

<p class='c001'>This was my first experience of the murderous instinct of
the wild Albanian, but ere three days I had still other opportunities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of reflecting upon Palok’s remark that Skodra was
not so safe a place as it looked.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, the town itself is, at intervals, threatened with
massacre. Every now and then rumours fly round that the
mountain tribes are about to descend upon the place and drive
out the Turks. Then everybody retires to their houses—each
residence has high walls, and is more or less a fortress—the
bazaar is closed, the shops are barricaded, and the ragged
soldiers of the Sultan assemble under their greasy-tunicked
officers—and wait.</p>

<p class='c001'>The blow for liberty has not yet been struck by the
Albanians, but it will assuredly come ere long.</p>

<p class='c001'>I wanted to investigate, and get at the truth. That is
the reason why those high, blue, misty mountains that I
could see afar from the narrow, crooked streets of Skodra
held me in such fascination; that is why I disregarded all
advice to the contrary, and determined to visit the Albanian
at home in his rocky fastness.</p>

<p class='c001'>That same night, after Salko had bargained for me, I was
eating my evening meal—of pork—when another shot sounded
out in the dark, unlit street.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was nothing, I was told by Palok five minutes later.
A man had been found dead in the darkness. That was all.</p>

<p class='c001'>The average number of assassinations in Scutari is about
three per day. Nobody cares, for justice is nobody’s business
except that of the dead man’s brother, or his next-of-kin.</p>

<p class='c001'>True, there is an Imperial Court of Justice, a lath-built
shed with gaping holes in the roof. Its steps are moss-grown,
and its windows mostly broken or devoid of glass.</p>

<p class='c001'>Outside the place, after midday, the brave defenders of the
Ottoman Empire, those shoeless men with their ragged uniforms
dropping off them, sell their ration of bread to the
passer-by in order to get money to buy cigarettes. They
remain unpaid, and their bread is their only source of income.
And upon the protection of these Skodra has to rely.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it any wonder that when sinister rumour runs through
the bazaar, everybody shoulders his rifle and sits on his wall,
prepared to defend his own home?</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER III <br /> THE LAWLESS LAND</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>My friend Pietro—Visit to his house—His wife and sister-in-law unveil and
are photographed—Scutarine hospitality—Forbidden newspapers—I
get one in secret—The Turkish post office—I want to visit the Accursed
Mountains—Difficulties and fears—The Feast of the Madonna—Christians
and Mohammedans—My first meeting with the dreaded Skreli—Shots
in the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those bright, sunny autumn days in Skodra will live for
a long time within my memory.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though a stranger in that half-savage place, where law
and order are unknown, I received perhaps more genuine
hospitality from perfect strangers than in any other place
in the Balkan Peninsula.</p>

<p class='c001'>Through Palok’s introduction I quickly found myself
among friends, who exerted their utmost in order to entertain
me, and went out of their way, even in face of their own
national customs and beliefs, to oblige me. The Albanian
idea of hospitality is old-world and charming. A case
in point was one of my friends, a wealthy Scutarine
merchant named Pietro Lekha, whose portrait is here reproduced.
He was a Christian, and spoke a little Italian. At
first, when I was introduced to him in the bazaar, he was
silent and taciturn, apparently regarding me with some suspicion;
but very soon this wore off, and we became the best of
friends. We took coffee together constantly, and he gave me
exquisite cigarettes. In Albania there is no <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>régie</i></span>, as in other
parts of Turkey, therefore one can choose from the peasant-women
the very best light tobacco in leaf, have it cut, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>afterwards employ professional cigarette-makers to manufacture
you cigarettes. I did this, and sent a quantity of cigarettes
of the very first quality to England, far milder and sweeter
than any to be purchased in Constantinople—or anywhere
else in the world, for the matter of that.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Finding that I was taking photographs, Pietro became
interested. He accompanied me on my expeditions, and we
had spent some days together before I dared to inquire about
his wife, the veiled lady whom I had once had pointed out
to me in the bazaar.</p>

<p class='c001'>Palok had told me that Pietro’s brother had, three months
ago, married the most beautiful girl in Skodra, and that he
and his young wife lived at Pietro’s house. A bold thing
then occurred to me—to beg permission to photograph them.</p>

<p class='c001'>I knew well that these people were averse to having their
photographs taken; nevertheless I very discreetly broached
the subject one day when sipping coffee with Pietro.</p>

<p class='c001'>He gave me no decided answer. Indeed, he declared
himself ready in any way to serve me, but as to photographing
his women-kind—well, it was against all custom. What
would his friends say if they knew?</p>

<p class='c001'>I dropped the subject, rather crestfallen. I wanted to be
invited to his house and to meet his wife and sister-in-law, both
of whom were declared to be very beautiful. Yet he seemed
in no way inclined to so far extend his hospitality. I spoke
to Palok and urged him to use his power of persuasion, with
the result that two days later I received an invitation from
Pietro to call upon him at his house at three o’clock to take
coffee, and further, he added—</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you really wish to bring your camera, you may. I
have spoken to my brother, and he will let you take a picture
of his wife, providing you give your undertaking not to make
any copies for sale, or to show it here to people in Skodra.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I willingly gave the undertaking, and at the appointed
hour, accompanied by Palok, we rang at the big gate in a
high white, prison-like wall that enclosed my friend’s dwelling,
and were admitted into the garden, in the centre of which
stood a great square house.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Pietro came forward to greet me, a picturesque figure in
his Scutarine dress, the flat fez with big tassel, the embroidered
coat, baggy trousers, and white stockings. The ground floor
was devoted to stables, but above we found ourselves in a
large square apartment with divans. Upon the floor were
beautiful Eastern rugs. On one side was the big, gaudily
painted dowry-chest, and here and there small low tables.
The room, with its heavy hangings, was very cosy, and over
everything was the sweet odour of otto-of-rose. In one
corner was a great brass brazier, and upon a chiffonier were
a few European knick-knacks, evidently household treasures.
The only picture on the wall was a small oleograph of the
Madonna.</p>

<p class='c001'>A rush-bottomed chair was produced for me, while Pietro
and Palok squatted cross-legged upon the divans. Then the
servant was sent to inform the ladies of our arrival.</p>

<p class='c001'>Presently both wife and sister-in-law entered, gorgeous
in silk and gold, the most striking costumes I have ever seen
off the stage. White gauze veils were wrapped about their
heads and corsage, leaving only their eyes visible; and thus
attired they saluted me and, with Pietro acting as interpreter,
welcomed me.</p>

<p class='c001'>Afterwards they retired, and at Pietro’s order reappeared
without their veils. The younger woman was indeed lovely,
with a fair white skin, beautiful soft lines of beauty, magnificent
black eyes, and lips that puckered into a sweet, modest smile
when I involuntarily expressed my surprise at her marvellous
good looks. I had heard that Albanian ladies were beautiful,
but I certainly never expected to be presented to such a type
of feminine loveliness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Over her bare chest hung strings of great gold coins, while
across her brow were rows of sequins. Her richly embroidered
dress, the jewels in her ears, the bangles upon her arms, all
enhanced her great personal beauty, while she stood before
me, her face downcast in modesty—for except her husband
and his brother no man had ever beheld her unveiled.</p>

<p class='c001'>At that moment her husband entered, and I congratulated
him upon the possession of such a beautiful wife. Then we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>all laughed together, and descended to the garden, where I
was allowed to take photographs of her, veiled and unveiled,
as well as of Pietro’s wife, who was, of course, much her senior,
and who, although she had lost her youthful beauty, was still
very charming.</p>

<p class='c001'>Returning again to the upstairs salon, we all sat round,
while the newly-married beauty brought us first lemonade,
then delicious Turkish coffee in tiny round cups upon a great
gilt tray, followed by <i>rakhi</i>, that spirit so dear to the Turkish
palate, and afterwards real <i>rahat-lakoum</i>, or Turkish delight.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, after an interval, veiled again once more, the beautiful
young woman brought me a cigarette and lit it for me,
afterwards wishing me adieu and modestly retiring.</p>

<p class='c001'>All was done with such perfect grace and modesty as to
create a most charming experience. It was, to say the least,
novel, to sit there with those squatting Albanians and be
waited upon by the prettiest girl in Skodra.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pietro told me that newspapers and books being forbidden,
anyone found in possession of them was at once arrested.
He, however, gave me surreptitiously a copy of the Rome
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Tribuna</cite></span>, which had been smuggled in a day or two before;
and it was welcome, being the first newspaper I had had for
several weeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>Truly Skodra is a strange place. I had occasion to go to
the Turkish post office one day. It was, I found, a wooden
shed. Inside was a low, filthy truckle bed, a small table—at
which sat a consumptive youth in a fez—a broken chair and
a large iron safe, the door being secured by a piece of string
being tied about it!</p>

<p class='c001'>Of drainage there is none. Sewage runs down the centre
of most of the streets, especially in the bazaar, and its odour
is the reverse of pleasant on a sunny day. In the neighbourhood
of butchers and slaughterers the gutters run with blood,
which the dogs lap and enjoy, and near the stalls of fruiterers
and vegetable-sellers the piles of refuse rot in the sun and
decay.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet everywhere, both in the streets of the Mohammedan
quarter and in those of the Christians, are interesting sights
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>at every turn. When night falls the place is dark and
mysterious, for there are no lights save that issuing from
the chinks of a door or from the windows of a barber or a
coffee-seller. Through the windows of a mosque, perhaps,
can be seen the swaying figures of Turks at prayer, faint in
the dim oil lights, while in the blackness of the street the
patrol passes, a dozen Turkish soldiers with loaded rifles,
headed by one man carrying a lantern. The place is insecure
after nightfall, even to the Scutarines themselves, therefore
nobody ventures out, and by nine o’clock every house is
bolted and barred.</p>

<p class='c001'>At that hour, it being Ramadan, the Turk was feasting
and taking his ease, while opposite the <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>han</i></span> where I lived a
Turkish soldier would come nightly and sing weird prayers
under the window of the Governor of the <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayet</i></span>, that perfectly
useless official, whose authority extends only to the
confines of the town itself, and who fears to exercise it lest
he should rouse the slumbering ire of those fierce tribes who
live in the Accursed Mountains above.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many strange sights I witnessed and many strange things
I heard in Skodra.</p>

<p class='c001'>Men, fierce mountaineers who, in some cases, bore across
their countenances marks of sword or gun-shot wounds, told
me their stories—exciting narratives of love, war, and the
blood-feud. All were Albanians, and believed Skodra to be
the finest capital in the world. England, because it carried
on no political intrigue among them, like Austria and Italy,
they did not regard as a Power. Mine was a country far
away, I was told, and therefore perfectly harmless. Hardly
anybody had heard of London. Those who had, declared that
it could not be so large or so beautiful as Skodra.</p>

<p class='c001'>The days I spent there were with the one object of obtaining,
by some means, permission from one or other of the
mountain chieftains to allow me to travel in the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Palok had promised to endeavour to arrange it for me,
and so had Pietro, but by their manner I saw that they considered
any such attempt a piece of sheer folly, and far too
hazardous. They were too polite to tell me so, but I read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>in their faces that they did not intend me to go, if it were
possible to prevent me.</p>

<p class='c001'>Therefore surreptitiously I had recourse to my faithful
friend of the bazaar, Salko, himself a member of the fierce
tribe of the Skreli, who had more than once terrorised the
town. When, through an interpreter, I one evening explained
my desire, he rubbed his chin doubtfully and wagged his head.
He would do his best, but it was dangerous—very dangerous,
he declared.</p>

<p class='c001'>And yet, he went on, the thing might perhaps be managed.
An Albanian of the mountains, though he might be a brigand
and annoyed the Turks, and though he might shoot Turkish
soldiers like dogs wherever met, was nevertheless a man of
his word. If I was promised safe escort, then I might go
into the mountains without even my revolver, for no harm
would come to me.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes; he would promise to see what he could do. But
it was difficult, and it would take time. In the mountains
they had no great love of foreigners.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the coming Feast of the Madonna many men from
the mountains would arrive, and there would be opportunity
to speak with them. No; he would say nothing to Palok—if
I so wished. Therefore I waited, and hoped.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the celebrated Madonna of Loretto was, before the
Turkish occupation of Skodra, at the little ruined church
near the Boyana River, and even now down to the annual <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>festà</i></span>
come representatives of all the various tribes, men and women,
from sometimes a week’s journey distant, filling the streets
with a perfect panorama of colour and costume.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Feast of the Madonna is indeed the day to see Skodra
at her best.</p>

<p class='c001'>You may travel the whole of Europe, from the Channel to
the Urals, or from the White Sea to the Bosphorus, and you
will never see such a variety of types and of costume as during
the two days of that feast.</p>

<p class='c001'>That clear sunny morning the whole town was agog. The
Christians had it to themselves, for while they feasted the
Mohammedans fasted. The two peoples keep distinctly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>apart during religious festivals, and Turkish soldiers, their
blue uniforms green with age, greasy at the collar, and often
shoeless, patrol the town, ready to fire on the people at the
least provocation. At least, so they say. If, however, they
did fire, then woe-betide them! Every man goes armed in
Skodra, and the garrison would certainly be wiped out were
the alarm once given to those wild fellows up in the mountains.</p>

<p class='c001'>All is orderly, however—all brilliant. The streets are
full of Christians from the country, the men tall, thin-legged
fellows, with black-and-white striped trousers and black
furry bolero, carrying loaded rifles upon their shoulders; and
the women in the various gay costumes of the tribes, each
wearing profusions of gold coins strung across their breasts,
heavy gold earrings, and the younger married ones with
dozens of gaudy silk handkerchiefs suspended round their
heavy brass or iron studded girdles, presents to them on their
recent marriage. Most of the <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>katunnare</i></span> (peasant-women
from the plains) are dressed in a short black homespun skirt
and bodice combined, reaching to the knees and embroidered
with red. Around the waist is a heavy hide belt about five
inches broad, studded with iron, and with two big polished
cornelians to form the buckle. Some are of antique silver of
beautiful workmanship, and others, more modern, are gilt.
These women wear nothing on their heads, but the gaily-dressed
<span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>malzore</i></span> (women of the mountains) wear a bright silk
handkerchief arranged very much in the same manner as the
women around Naples. The <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>malzore</i></span> are extremely good-looking,
and all carry a small embroidered sack over their
shoulder, for in Skodra on the night prior to the <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>Festà</i></span> of the
Madonna every Christian house is open to receive visitors
and give them food and shelter, whoever they may be. So
these little sacks contain humble presents to the hosts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Pietro met me in the street as I was going to the Cathedral,
and told me that on the previous night he had given food and
beds to twenty-eight mountaineers of both sexes. Albanian
hospitality is certainly unbounded.</p>

<p>The Procession with an Armed Guard.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>As I strolled through the narrow lanes of the Christian
quarter towards the Cathedral, and the gaily-dressed chattering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>women in groups hurried forward to get a place within, I was
struck with their neat and clean appearance. Their finery
was in no way dingy or dusty, and yet many of them had been
a whole week on a journey through perhaps the roughest
region in the whole East.</p>

<p class='c001'>How different was the <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>festà</i></span> to that I had known in the
Italian towns!</p>

<p class='c001'>About the Cathedral there is nothing unusually attractive—a
big bare edifice with high square campanile in modern
Italian style. It stands in the centre of an open space, surrounded
by great high, fortress-like walls, entered by a strong
gate with huge iron bars—significant that one day ere long
it will be held against the Turks. No Mohammedan ever
passes those gates. Even the military patrol lounge outside,
leaning on their rifles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Within the enclosure I found a great crowd of peasant
women; females of the town, veiled with gauze so fine that
one could almost see their faces; Scutarine men in their best
jackets and baggy trousers; and the swaggering, white-capped
warriors from the mountains, men of the Miriditi,—so dreaded
by the Turks that they are allowed to carry their rifles with
them,—of the fierce Skreli, the Hoti, and the Kastrati.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Skreli, with the Miriditi, are allowed to carry their
rifles because the Turks hold them in fear. The authorities
know full well that to arouse their ire would be to bring destruction
upon the whole <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayet</i></span>, for they hold the communications,
and if the tribes revolted, as they no doubt would, then
the army of the Sultan would have a very hard task to suppress
the rebellion.</p>

<p class='c001'>So while the Kastrati and the Hoti—also dwellers in the
Mountains of the Accursed—the Klementi, the Shiala of the
foot-hills, and the others are compelled to leave their rifles
at the entrance to the town, the Skreli and the Miriditi stalk
along in armed bands of twenty or thirty through the streets
to the church, grinning defiance at the Turks, who are supposed
by Europe to be their masters.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under the trees around the Cathedral the wild, fierce men,
who would hold the traveller to ransom or shoot him with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>less compunction than they would kill a shepherd-dog, were
squatting in rings with their rifles before them, gossiping.
Every man wore a belt full of cartridges and a bandolier
across his shoulders—sometimes even two. War and religion
are strangely mixed in Skodra.</p>

<p class='c001'>Into the dimly-lit Cathedral I managed to squeeze, and
there, kneeling on the stones and filling the whole place right
out into the grass enclosure, were men of all grades, from the
peaceful Scutarine merchant to the wild tribesman, and
women with their faces uncovered bowed towards the brilliantly
lit altar, where the thin-faced Italian priest mumbled the
prayers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sight was strangely impressive; the silence unbroken
save for the low voice of the priest and now and then the
clank of arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>For two days in the year, to celebrate the Christian
festival, the brigand tribes from the mountains come down,
notwithstanding that upon the heads of many of those
sinister-looking men before me the Turks had long ago set
a price. I stood gazing at that kneeling throng, to whom,
though devout and humble in God’s house, murder was
deemed no wrong.</p>

<p class='c001'>The service ended, a great procession was formed, and
headed by four fine stalwart men of the Skreli with loaded
rifles, made a slow tour from the altar outside and round
the enclosure, while an orchestra in a band-stand opposite
played selections. The sight was curious—those armed men
ready to protect their priests in case of sudden onslaught
by the Turks.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the whole morning I took many photographs, and
in the afternoon, when I returned, I found the orchestra
playing operatic music, which was being listened to by the
tribesmen with marked attention. They are, I afterwards
found, devoted to music. The programme ranged from
selections from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>La Bohème</i></span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Carmen</i></span> to the “Segovia”
valse and our old melodious friend, “The Honeysuckle and
the Bee.” The latter air quickly became popular among the
tribesmen, who picked it up and began at once to whistle it.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Slowly fell the mystic twilight of the East. The glorious
afterglow had deepened into grey, and night was creeping
on quickly when fire balloons were sent up, and then gradually
the whole Cathedral became outlined in fairy lamps against
the steely sky, even to the utmost point of the high square
tower. Men and women gazed upward, and crossed themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Later, while walking back with Palok, we encountered a
group of armed tribesmen talking excitedly, shaking their
fists, and apparently quarrelling. Palok joined the crowd,
and inquired what had happened. Then, turning to me, he
said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, it is nothing, signore. The town of Kroia has
revolted. The Turks sent soldiers yesterday, but they were
Albanians, and would not fire on the people. To-day some
artillery arrived, and thirty people have been killed—mostly
women. A man has just ridden in with the news. It
is nothing. We are always fighting the Turks at Kroia.
There will probably be a massacre to-night.” And he deftly
rolled a cigarette as he spat in defiance of the hated Mussulman.</p>

<p class='c001'>Later that night I was awakened from sleep by a shot
below, and, taking my revolver, went to the window. The
night was black, and I could discern nothing.</p>

<p class='c001'>I heard men’s voices raised in the street below, and suddenly
saw the red flash of firearms and heard a second report.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then all was quiet, except receding footsteps.</p>

<p class='c001'>The shots disturbed nobody, or if they did, nobody
opened door or window. The town was asleep, and by the
distant sound of a tom-tom I knew that the hour was half-past
three; for the music was calling upon the Faithful to eat,
preparatory to the day’s fast.</p>

<p class='c001'>What had happened? All was silent, therefore I closed
my window and slept again.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the morning I was told that it was “nothing.” Two
men of the Shiala had been found dead outside.</p>

<p class='c001'>Was it the blood-feud? I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>Palok only raised his shoulders and exhibited his palms.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was nothing, signore—really nothing.”</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER IV <br /> IN THE ACCURSED MOUNTAINS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Vatt Marashi, chief of the Skreli tribe, invites me to become his guest—Our
start for the Accursed Mountains—Rok, our guide—Independence of
the Skreli—Brigandage and the <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>bessa</i></span>—A night under a rock—My
meeting with Vatt Marashi and his band—The Skreli welcome—How
they treat the Turks—Vatt’s admissions—I become the guest of brigands—A
chat in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c007'>While seated on the box in Salko’s dark little stall in
the bazaar he introduced his friend Rok to me.</p>

<p class='c001'>A middle-aged tribesman in the regulation costume of
tight white woollen trousers heavily striped with black, black
bolero with deep woollen fringe, and a felt skullcap, once
white, but now not overclean, he squatted opposite me and
touched chin and brow in salute. His loaded rifle lay before
him on the ground.</p>

<p class='c001'>He eyed me critically up and down, my pigskin gaiters
apparently receiving his admiration.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rok, here, is of the Skreli, a fearless fighter of the Turks
and one of my best friends,” Salko went on to explain. “I
have told him of your earnest desire to go and see our country;
that you are neither Austrian nor Italian, but English and
not a spy. Our friend is returning to-day, and has promised
to speak to Vatt Marashi, our chief, on your behalf.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tell the honourable Englishman that if he comes to us
he must be prepared for a rough life. We live in the mountains,”
Rok said through the interpreter, laughing pleasantly
as he lit the cigarette he took from my case.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coffee was brought, and we sealed our compact of friendliness.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>If Vatt Marashi, the renowned chieftain who so often held
travellers to ransom, and whose influence was so dreaded by
the Turks, consented to allow me to visit him, then Rok
would return, he promised, and be my guide.</p>

<p class='c001'>For half an hour we chatted and smoked. Then the burly
mountaineer rose, slung his rifle over his shoulder, touched
chin and brow again, grasped my hand warmly, and stalked
out on his three days’ tramp to the wild region in the mountain
mists that was his home.</p>

<p class='c001'>I waited on in Skodra, and, to my great delight, he one
morning reappeared with a message from his chief that, providing
I took only Palok, and had no escort, he would be
pleased to welcome me and show me all the hospitality in his
power. I need fear nothing, it was added. I was to be guest
of Vatt Marashi, chief of the Skreli. He had issued the order
to the tribe. Any who dared to insult or injure me should
pay for it with their life. Therefore I should be given safe-conduct,
and need not have a moment’s anxiety.</p>

<p class='c001'>By this, Palok, who had been entirely opposed to the
attempt, became reassured, and soon after noon, with a mule
packed with my lightest baggage, we set our faces out across
the great rolling plain that lies between the town and the
high wall of blue distant mountains—the wildest corner of all
Europe. They are a series of fastnesses, in which any small
army would at once be massacred and where a large one
would starve.</p>

<p class='c001'>We were a merry trio as we marched forward in the bright
autumn sunlight, but about a kilometre beyond the town the
road ended in a ford, where we crossed a wide shallow river,
and then straight across the plain and past several tumuli
to where a defile showed in the mountains. The ancient
Bridge of Messi, built under the Venetian dominion, was
crossed, and then we had our first experience of the road in
Albania—a rough, narrow way gradually ascending, almost too
bad even for mules.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nobody who has not visited Northern Albania can have any
idea of the wildness of those bare grey rocks, of the roughness
of the tracks, or the savagery of life there. Northern Albania
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>is to-day just as it was under the Roman Empire. The might
of Rome has waned, the Servian has come and gone, the
Venetian has been swept away, and the Turk is now nominally
master. But the country has never, through all the centuries,
been annexed, and those wild tribes, descendants of the savage
people who inhabited those fastnesses before the days of
Greek dominion, have never been tamed. The Northern
Albanian is the last survivor of mediæval days. He has no
written language—indeed, his alphabet, with its many soft
and hard “ssh” sounds, has never yet been determined—therefore
he has no literature and no newspaper. Thin, wiry,
and muscular, he wears raw-hide slippers, in which he moves
with cat-like, stealthy tread—a habit survived from prehistoric
days—while his very dress is protective, rendering
him at a short distance difficult to discern, so like is he in
colour to the rocky background. He looks as though he had
just stepped down from a mediæval Florentine fresco, with
his head half-shaven, hair long at the back and cut square
across the shoulders.</p>

<p class='c001'>He is entirely unchanged ever since the Turk found him,
except that of late he has adopted the breech-loading rifle
and a particularly heavy pattern of revolver. The black
furry bolero which he wears, without exception, is the sign of
mourning for his great prince, Skender Beg, who died in 1467,
after being at war with the Turks for over twenty years;
therefore with him fashions do not easily change, and “latest
novelties” in dress are unknown. Great are the changes that
have come over the world during the past thousand years
or so, but Northern Albania has remained unaffected by them,
and is still in a measure in the lowest depths of barbarism.
The Turk does not rule. The wild, inaccessible country is
under the various independent tribes, ruled by a chieftain
according to unwritten laws which have been handed down
orally from remote ages, and one of the fiercest and most
independent of these chiefs was Vatt Marashi, the man whose
guest I now was to be.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>The way to the Skreli.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Compared with the tribesmen, the Albanian Christian of
Skodra is a puny person. The mountaineers are a barbaric,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>lawless people, without any education save the schools established
by Italian and Austrian monks as part of the political
propaganda; for, truth to tell, both countries have recently
conceived the idea of turning Northern Albania to account
for their own purposes on the day of the downfall of the Turk.
Therefore both Powers are frantically exerting every effort to
curry favour with the people, a fact which is glaringly apparent
even to the rough, uneducated tribesmen themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Northern Albanian may be entirely uneducated and a
barbarian, but he is at heart a brigand, and is certainly no fool.</p>

<p class='c001'>My friend Rok was particularly intelligent, and as we
toiled along over those rough, rock-strewn paths he gave me
much information about his country, and declared that both
Austria and Italy were equally their enemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>After sundown we rested at a point high up above a dark
gloomy defile, where a stream wound away towards the plain,
and there ate some slices of cold mutton and black bread
with a glass of <i>rakhi</i>, our three rifles lying at hand in case of
sudden emergency.</p>

<p class='c001'>I had noticed the queer, sinuous, almost uncanny way in
which Rok walked. His movements, at even pace whatever
might be the state of the path, were stealthy. Indeed, he
almost crept along, for his feet fell in silence, and with his
rifle ever ready, his keen black eyes were searching on every
side for the enemy which he appeared to expect to meet at
every turn.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes as he walked in front he would halt, and closely
scan a mass of tumbled rocks, as though he had suspicion of
a lurking enemy, then thoroughly satisfying himself, he would
go forward again without glancing back. He was certain
that no enemy was in his rear.</p>

<p class='c001'>From his movements and natural caution I could plainly
see that we were traversing a country not altogether friendly,
and when, as we sat over our evening meal, I asked Palok,
his reply was—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Shiala are not on very friendly terms with the
Skreli just now. But it is nothing, signore—nothing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We went forward until darkness closed in, and then lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>down to sleep under an overhanging rock almost on the face of
a sheer precipice, a place in which Rok told us he often stayed
on his way down to Skodra. He humorously called it his
<span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>han</i></span>, or hotel.</p>

<p class='c001'>To light a fire would be to attract hostile attention, and
the cold up there was intense. I tried to sleep, but was unable,
therefore I rose and sat outside in the bright, glorious moonlight
and kept watch, while Rok curled himself up like a dog
and snored soundly in chorus with Palok.</p>

<p class='c001'>There, in the East, the full moon seems to shine with
greater brilliance than in Europe, and beneath its white rays
those bare, rugged mountains looked like a veritable fairyland.
Only the cry of a night-bird and the low music of the
stream far below broke the stillness of the Oriental night,
and as I sat there I reflected that I was the first Englishman
who had ever been the guest of the redoubtable chieftain,
Vatt Marashi, the man whom the Turks so hate—the man of
whom blood-curdling tales had been told me both in Montenegro
and in Skodra, and whose fame as a leader of a wild
band had not long before been proclaimed by the London
newspapers.</p>

<p class='c001'>For hours I sat thinking, sometimes of my good fortune,
at others of my perilous position alone in the hands of such a
people. But I had heard that, notwithstanding their barbaric
customs, an Albanian’s word was his bond. Therefore
I reassured myself that I should not be the victim of treachery,
and reported to Constantinople as “missing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Slowly at last the moon paled, and I grew sleepy. That
terrible road had worn me out. Therefore I woke Palok to
mount guard, and flung myself down in his place and slept
till the sun, shining in my face, awakened me.</p>

<p class='c001'>Through the whole day we went forward again, over a
path so bad that I often had to scramble with difficulty. I
tried to ride the mule, but it was out of the question, so I
walked and stumbled and was helped over the rough boulders
by my companions. The Skreli country was surely an unapproachable
region.</p>

<p class='c001'>That night we slept again in the open, but in a spot less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>sheltered. Then forward again with the first grey of dawn
until, just before noon, Rok halted in the narrow track which
wound round the face of the bare grey mountain, and, drawing
his revolver, fired three times in the air.</p>

<p class='c001'>The shots reverberated in a series of echoes. It was a
signal, and almost ere they had died away came three answering
shots from no great distance, and I was told that we were
now in the Skreli region, and there was nothing more to fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Podgoritza, in Cettinje, in Skodra, and in Djakova I
had heard terrible stories of this fighting race, and of Vatt’s
fierce hatred of the Turks. Yet everyone had told me that,
the chief having invited me, I need have not a moment’s
apprehension of my personal safety.</p>

<p class='c001'>So I went forward, reassured, to meet my host.</p>

<p class='c001'>Half an hour later I came face to face with real brigands—brigands
who looked like an illustration out of a boy’s story-book—the
men who had so often held up travellers and compelled
the Turkish Government to pay heavy ransoms.</p>

<p class='c001'>They were about twenty, certainly the fiercest and most
bloodthirsty gang I have ever set my eyes upon. Dressed
in the usual skin-tight white woollen trousers with broad
black bands running down the legs, a short white jacket, also
black-braided, the sleeveless woolly bolero of mourning, hide
shoes with uppers consisting of a network of string, and
small white skullcaps, each man carried in his belt a great
silver-mounted pistol of antique type and a silver-sheathed
curved knife, while around both shoulders were well-filled
bandoliers, and in the hand of each a rifle. Like Rok, the
heads of all were shaved, leaving a long tuft at the back in the
mediæval Florentine style.</p>

<p class='c001'>With one accord they all raised their rifles aloft and shouted
me welcome, whereupon one man stepped forward—a big,
muscular fellow with handsome face and proud gait—the great
chief Vatt Marashi himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Attired very much as his followers, his dress was richer,
the jacket being ornamented with gold braid. The silver hilt
of his pistol was studded with coral and green stones, probably
emeralds, but he carried no rifle. Jauntily, and laughing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>merrily, he approached me and bent until his forehead touched
mine—the Skreli sign of welcome.</p>

<p class='c001'>And all this in Europe in the twentieth century!</p>

<p class='c001'>Was I dreaming? Was it real? I was the guest of actual
brigands, those men about whom I had read in story-books
ever since those long-ago days when the weekly <cite>Boys of
England</cite> formed my chief literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>Vatt Marashi, holding my hand the while, addressed me.
What he said was interpreted into Italian by Palok as—</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are welcome here to my country—very welcome.
And you are an Englishman, and have travelled so far to see
us! It is wonderful—wonderful! You live so far away—farther
than Constantinople, they say. Well, I cannot give
you much here or make you very comfortable—not so comfortable
as you have been down in Skodra. But I will do my
best. Come—let us eat.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I returned his greeting, whereupon the whole crowd of us
walked along to a spot where a cauldron was standing upon
a wood fire, and out of it my host, myself, and Palok had
pieces of boiled chicken and rice, which had specially been
prepared for my coming.</p>

<p class='c001'>The object of this meal, I afterwards learnt, was to cement
our friendship. The Albanian code of honour is astounding,
even to our Western ideas. A word once given by those
savage tribes is never broken, and if the stranger eats the
food of the Skreli, even though he may be an enemy, his
person is sacred for twenty-four hours afterwards. While
the food remains undigested he may not be injured or captured.</p>

<p class='c001'>And so while I ate with this wild chieftain, his band squatted
round, apparently discussing me.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was probably the first time they had seen an Englishman,
Palok explained, and they were at first inclined to regard
me as a secret agent of the Government, until later that
afternoon their chief assured them to the contrary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then that wild horde became, to a man, my devoted
servants.</p>

<div id='i074'  class='figcenter id004'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>Vatt Marashi</span>, Chief of the Skreli tribe.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Vatt, the <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>Baryaktar</i></span> (from the Turkish <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>bairakdar</i></span>, or
standard-bearer), unlike most Albanians, is fair-haired, above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the average height, extremely muscular, with a constant
smile of hearty good-fellowship. His eyes are fierce and
barbaric; nevertheless he is pleasant of countenance, and I
certainly found him, from first to last, a staunch and excellent
friend.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lord of those wild, rugged mountains, his word was obeyed
with a precision that amazed me. A striking figure he presented
as, with me, he marched at head of his bodyguard,
his chest thrown out proudly, his head up, his keen eyes ever
searching forward like every Albanian of the hills, one of the
wildest rulers of wildest Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>On every side, as we went forward to the tiny cluster of
little houses that formed the village where I was to be quartered,
were bare grey limestone rocks without a single blade
of grass, a desolate mountain region into which no foreigner
had penetrated save when captured and held to ransom.
Through centuries have that same tribe ruled that barren
land, and no conqueror of Albania has ever succeeded in
ousting them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have, no doubt, heard down in Skodra terrible
things about me,” he said, laughing, as, later on, we walked
together. He had rolled me a cigarette and given it to me
unstuck. “I expect you feared to come and see me—eh?”</p>

<p class='c001'>I admitted that I had heard things of him not altogether
satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah!” he laughed, “that is because the Turks do not
like us. Whenever a Turkish soldier puts his foot a kilometre
outside Skodra, we either take away his Mauser and send
him back, or else—well, we shoot him first.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But they say that your men capture travellers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And why not?” he asked. “We are Christians. Is it
not permissible for us to do everything to annoy those devils
of Turks? But,” he added, “if they say that I treat my
prisoners badly, they lie. Why, they get plenty of food and
are well treated. I give them some shooting if they like—and
they generally enjoy themselves. But I know. I too
have been told that the Turks say I once cut off a man’s ears.
Bah! all Turks are liars.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“Then it is only to annoy the Turks that your men commit
acts of brigandage?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course. The ransom is useful to us, I admit, but we
live by our flocks, and our wants are few. We are not like
the people down in Skodra. We are better, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And do you always watch the roads on the other side of
the mountains yonder?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Always. Our men are there now, all along the route
between Ipek and Prisrend. Who knows who may not pass
along—a rich Pasha perhaps.” And his face relaxed into a
humorous smile at thought of such a prize.</p>

<p class='c001'>And then I marched along, my rifle over my shoulder—a
brigand for the nonce like my host.</p>

<p class='c001'>Surely it was one of the quaintest experiences of a varied
and adventurous life.</p>

<p class='c001'>The tiny house in which I was given quarters had an
earthen floor and consisted of two rooms, the ceilings and
walls of which were blackened by the smoke of years. The
owner was an old man with his wife and daughter, the latter
being a pretty young woman of about nineteen, dressed in
the gorgeous gala costume with golden sequins, the same that
I had seen down at Skodra during the <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>festà</i></span>. She had on
her best in my honour, I suppose, and her husband, a good-looking
young fellow five years her senior, seemed justly proud
of her. His name was Lûk. I named him Lucky, but he did
not appreciate the wit. He was, I found, one of the chief’s
bodyguard who had come to greet me at the confines of the
Skreli territory, and proved a most sociable fellow, ever ready
to render me a service.</p>

<p class='c001'>“These good people will look after you and make you as
comfortable as they can,” my host said, when he had introduced
me to them. “I have to go along the ravine, but will
return in time to eat with you this evening. You like good
cigarettes? I will send you some.” And he shook my hands,
and turning, went out, stalking again at the head of his
ferocious-looking band.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>An Albanian Village.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The bedroom, occupied in common by the family, was
given over to me. My bed on the floor was a big sack filled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>with dried maize-leaves. It was not inviting, but Palok,
having examined it critically, declared it to be “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>cosi cosi</i></span>,”
and having slept out a couple of nights, I was compelled to
accept his verdict.</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl in the sequins boiled us coffee over the fire,
and with her father and husband I sat outside the house in
the golden sunset, smoking and chatting. Both were full of
curiosity. England was to them a mere legendary land, and
they had never heard of London. When I mentioned it they
declared that it could not possibly be so large as Skodra.</p>

<p class='c001'>I told them of Cettinje and other towns in Montenegro I
had visited, but they held all Montenegro in contempt, for
were they not always raiding over the frontier? Lûk declared
that he had walked in Podgoritza openly, and in the marketplace
shot a man with whom he was in <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>gyak</i></span>, or blood-feud.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I walked out again, and no one dared to stop me,” he
added, with pride. “It would have been worse for them if
they had.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the Montenegrins are no cowards,” I ventured to
remark.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly not. They are very brave, but they dare not
follow us here. They always get lost in the mountains, and
once they lose their way they lose their lives,” he added, with
a grin. “Our men killed four over yonder mountain a few
days ago.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The blood-feud?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course. It arose out of that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>From the half-dozen other poor mountain homes came
forth men, women, and children, who grouped around us,
watching in curiosity. According to Palok, rumour had at
first gone round that I was a prisoner, therefore they had
refrained from coming forth to see me. Now, however, they
knew the truth, they welcomed me as their guest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Just before it grew dark the <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>Baryaktar</i></span> returned, followed
by the bodyguard, without whom he never seemed to move.
They did his bidding, executed his orders, and were ever at
his beck and call—the picked men of the tribe.</p>

<p class='c001'>While Vatt squatted on the floor I sat upon my suit-case,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and together we ate a kind of mutton stew, rather rich, but
not unpalatable. There was an absence of table cutlery,
therefore we ate with the aid of our pocket-knives and fingers.
Now and then the old woman would pick a tit-bit out of the
pot and hand it to me with her fingers. I was compelled to
accept the well-meant hospitality, even though her hands
were not particularly clean.</p>

<p class='c001'>The hot dish was tasty, but I could not manage the
sour black bread, for it was mouldy, and gritty into the
bargain.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a weird picture, the interior of that lowly hut, lit
by the dim oil lamp of almost the same type as used by the
early Greeks. The uncertain firelight glinted upon the gold
of the dresses of the chieftain and of Lûk’s pretty wife, and
threw, now and then, into relief those strangely unfamiliar
faces, the barbarians of an age bygone and forgotten. The
very language they were speaking was, as an unwritten one,
utterly incomprehensible and unintelligible to any but the
born Albanian.</p>

<p class='c001'>I rubbed my eyes—on account of the smoke—wondering
if it were really only a very few weeks ago that I had driven
a motor from London down to Windsor, that I had seen
<cite>The Catch of the Season</cite>, and trod the red carpet of the
Savoy afterwards.</p>

<p class='c001'>And to-night I was actually having supper with real live
brigands of the mountains!</p>

<p class='c001'>Lûk produced a bottle of <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>rakhi</i></span>, and Vatt Marashi lifted his
tin mug to me. I took a little of the potent spirit in the
bottom of my own drinking-cup, and tossed it off. It was not
half as bad as I expected.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the chief took me outside the house, and in the
clear moonlight we sat down with Palok upon a big rock
to chat.</p>

<p class='c001'>He rolled me a cigarette of most excellent Turkish tobacco—of
his own growing, he told me—lit one himself, and we
sipped the coffee brought to us by Lûk’s wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>The scene spread before us was superb—a magnificent
panorama of mountains, some tipped with snow, white and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>brilliant under the moonbeams. Below us, the valley was a
great chasm of unfathomable blackness.</p>

<p class='c001'>With my strange host I chatted upon many subjects, and
found him far more intelligent than I had believed. Keen-witted,
quick of perception, just in his judgment, and yet
filled with an intense hatred of both Turk and Montenegrin
alike, he explained to me many things of great interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>He told me of the glorious traditions of his sturdy race
and of the prince of the Skender Beg family, who, they hoped,
would one day come back to rule them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We, the chieftains, hold authority from him,” he declared.
“Oh yes, he will come some day. Of that we are
quite certain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Englishmen have never dared to come here, have they?”
I asked, with some curiosity.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Only once—a year or two ago. I discovered three of
your compatriots poking about in the rocks and chipping
little pieces off. I had them captured, and brought to me.
At first I thought I would hold them to ransom and make
the Turks pay. But they were evidently poor fellows, for
their clothes were worn almost to rags, and they had very
little money. So I gave them their money back and sent
them with an escort down to the plain, forbidding them to
enter our country again. I wonder why they came, and why
they were chipping the rocks?”</p>

<p class='c001'>I told him that they were evidently mining prospectors;
that Englishmen travelled all over the world to discover
minerals; and that a mine in his country would be a source of
great wealth. But my explanation did not appeal to him.
He could not see why they were chipping off those pieces of
rock. It was not flint, otherwise they might have wanted
them for gun-locks. No, the trio were distinctly suspicious
characters, and he was glad that he had expelled them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you ever held Englishmen to ransom?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c001'>“One. Five years ago. He came here shooting—after
bears, I think. He was evidently a great gentleman, for his
guns were beautiful. The Turks paid promptly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because he was an Englishman—eh?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Most probably,” he laughed. “Are they afraid of you
English as they are afraid of us?”</p>

<p class='c001'>And soon afterwards he bade me good-night, and left me to
throw myself down upon my mattress of leaves and listen to
the snoring of Palok and the assembled family in the adjoining
room.</p>

<p class='c001'>I had thought Skodra barbaric, but here I was in an utterly
unknown corner of the earth, in an absolutely savage land—a
land that knows no law and acknowledges no master; a land
that is the same to-day as it was in the days of Diocletian and
of Constantine the Great—Albania the Unchanging.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER V <br /> LIFE WITH A BRIGAND BAND</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The Skreli a lawless tribe—No man’s life safe unless the chief gives his word—Vatt
prophesies a rising against the Turks—Our walks and talks—Our
meeting with our neighbours the Kastrati, and with Dêd Presci
their chief—A woman who avenged her husband’s death—The significant
story of Kol—Manners and customs of the wild tribes—Farewell to my
good friend Dêd—An incident a fortnight later.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bright sunny days I remained with the Skreli were
full of interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>On every hand, from Vatt himself down to the humblest
of his tribe, I received only the greatest kindness and hospitality.
If I went out in Vatt’s absence, a dozen armed banditti
followed me, mounting guard over me; for, as they told me,
one never knew what little “accident” might happen. With
the tribes of the Shiala and the Pulati they were not just then
on particularly friendly terms, and there had been a series
of sharp encounters a week ago. Having given their word to
be responsible for my safety, it behoved them to take precautions.</p>

<p class='c001'>I walked with Vatt Marashi every day, making long excursions
through the mountains by the secret paths known only
to the tribe.</p>

<p class='c001'>Would I care for some sport? If I cared to come next
year and bring a friend, or even two, he would let me shoot.
My friends would always be welcome, and I could assure
them of their safety. There was plenty of game, and lots of
bears, lynx, and wolves. I should tell my friends in England,
and come back for a month or two. I promised that I would,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>for in our walks I saw quantities of game. My friend shot
several eagles, but I was not successful in bagging one.</p>

<p class='c001'>As he was stalking at my side one afternoon, his argus
eyes everywhere and a cigarette in his mouth, I returned to
the subject of the Turks and their “occupation” of Albania.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bah!” he exclaimed, with a sneering curl of the lip.
“They dare not come here. We, with the Kastrati, the
Hoti, the Klementi, the Pulati, and the Shiala, are masters here.
We have held the land always, and shall hold it still. We
acknowledge no law except our own, and pay no taxes to
anybody. The Turks, when they conquered Northern Albania,
thought they could crush us. They tried to, but soon discovered
their mistake. So ever since that they have left us
severely alone, and retired into Skodra. They know full well
that when we unite with our brothers, the Miriditi, in the south,
then Skodra will be at our mercy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if the Sultan sends his soldiers here?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, and what then?” he asked, with a flash in his
eyes. “Do you think we fear them? Many of them are
Albanians, and would not fight us. Again, you have experienced
the road here. What would an army do here? We should
pick them off as fast as they came up. There are forty
thousand of us Skreli alone, remember, without all the other
tribes. If a Turkish army came in here, depend upon it, it
would never get out again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And is there likely to be a rising against the Turks?”
I inquired, much interested.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, of course. The revolt will come one day ere long—when
we are ready. We can, however, afford to wait at
present. Turkey will soon have her hands full with Bulgaria
and Macedonia, and then—well, we shall help Bulgaria, and
in a week there won’t be a Turk in Skodra.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You mean there will be a massacre?”</p>

<p class='c001'>For answer he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And after the revolution?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“After we have driven out the Turk we hope to obtain
our independence under either France or some other far-off
country—England, for instance. Austria and Italy are,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>through their priests, conducting a strenuous propaganda all
through Northern Albania—so strenuous as to be ridiculous.
They foolishly think that we are like children, and that we
do not discern their ulterior motives. Oh, it is very amusing,
I can tell you! We accept their schools and their money, and
put our fingers in our cheeks, for we don’t intend to have
anything to do with either Power when the rising comes. We
will help Servia or Bulgaria, or even Montenegro, to drive the
Turk from Albania, but we will not lift a finger for either
Italy or Austria. The secret agents of both Powers are always
endeavouring to penetrate here among us and carry on their
propaganda. But we do not want them, and will not have
them. More than one has of late—disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Shot?”</p>

<p class='c001'>He smiled in the affirmative.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is true,” he said, “that we kill—and kill often—for
the vendetta—for espionage—and in the frontier disputes with
Montenegro. Alas! we have here but little of the <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>bessa</i></span>
(truce). But you must remember we are not like you English.
The people have no government, except myself. I make the
law, and they obey. We are Christians. We believe in God
and in the Virgin, and soon we will drive the Mohammedan
fanatics from our land.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He spoke with an air of conviction, and, judging from
my observations while I was guest of his tribe, I believe
that when war between Turkey and Bulgaria comes—as it
must come one day before long—these wild people will sweep
down upon the Turks and play frightful havoc with them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Skodra is often alarmed, and the people retire into their
houses and bar their doors because the tribes are believed
to be coming. One day they will come, and when they do
those open drains in the streets will run with blood. The
sign of the cross upon the Christian houses is in preparation
for the day of vengeance.</p>

<p class='c001'>My walks with Vatt Marashi, though often very fatiguing,
were full of interest. He was never tired of making inquiries
regarding England and England’s power. Did the Sultan
recognise England as an independent state, and did we send
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>an Ambassador to the Sublime Porte, like Austria and Germany?
He knew that England once had a Vice-Consul in Skodra—but
he committed suicide, it was said, poor fellow.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing very extraordinary, I remarked inwardly.
Doomed to live in such an out-of-the-world place as Skodra
would be sufficient to drive any European to take his life. Of
brigandage, Vatt Marashi told me that they held up but
few travellers nowadays, and only, indeed, when there was
necessity. Yet a year or two ago they held the worst reputation
of any of the tribes.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day while we were climbing the rocks—for Vatt and
his bodyguard thought that they might get a shot at a bear—there
was a sudden alarm. The hawk’s eyes of my companions
espied strangers, and a sudden halt was called. In a moment
we were all under cover of the rocks. Every man unslung his
rifle, and Vatt himself, with knit brows, drew his big pistol with
silver butt, while I crouched behind a rock with my rifle ready,
expecting something to happen.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing, however, did happen, for a few moments later
there were shouts from the opposite side of the defile, answered
by my companions, who came forth and waved their rifles over
their heads as sign of greeting.</p>

<p class='c001'>Vatt, replacing his pistol in his belt, spoke in a loud, sharp
voice, and received an answer. Those mountaineers can
throw their voices long distances, and be heard distinctly, a
fact I often noticed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Palok told me that the strangers were of the neighbouring
tribe, the Kastrati, and that their chief, Dêd Presci,
had come to pay Vatt a visit.</p>

<p class='c001'>For me this was fortunate, for it gave me an opportunity of
meeting the other ruler of Northern Albania; for next to the
Skreli the Kastrati are most powerful in the Accursed
Mountains.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Mrika</span>, the woman who carried on the blood-feud.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Half an hour later we met our visitors. Dressed very
similarly to my companions, they wore white tassel-less fezes
instead of the little white skullcap, and the black stripes
down their trousers were somewhat different. The two chieftains
touched foreheads, and I was afterwards introduced.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Dêd Presci, a round-faced, pleasant man, rather stout and
burly, his hair cut in mediæval style, gripped me warmly by
the hand, saying—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I heard that you were in Skodra during the <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>festà</i></span>. Some
of my men told me there was an Englishman. But I never
expected to meet you. Perhaps you are coming across to see
me—eh? If so, you are quite welcome.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I may come next year to shoot, with a couple of English
friends. May I visit you then?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Most certainly. You have only to warn me of your
coming through one of our men down in Skodra, and I will
give you safe escort,” was his reply. “If you are fond of
sport, you will find plenty with us. Only bring a tent, and
perhaps some provisions; for our food is not what you foreigners
are used to.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I shall return one day before long,” I promised.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do. You need fear nothing, you know. We never
betray a friend.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Or forgive an enemy,” added Vatt, laughing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Especially if he be a Turk,” I remarked; whereat both
chiefs laughed in chorus.</p>

<p class='c001'>That evening I ate with the pair in a small lonely house
on the mountainside, and the moon had long risen before
Palok and I returned to Lûk’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>My photographic camera was, from the first, regarded with
a good deal of suspicion, and it was with very great difficulty
I persuaded anybody to have his picture taken. Many
surreptitious snap-shots I took with a small “Brownie”
camera, for unfortunately I had run out of films for my own
larger Kodak. But I was able to secure some photographs,
which now appear in this volume.</p>

<p class='c001'>Early one morning, soon after sunrise, I was walking with
Lûk and Palok when a young woman passed us.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is Mrika Kol Marashut,” Lûk remarked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And who is she?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mrika—the woman who carried on the blood-feud,” was
his answer. “Two years ago she was the most beautiful girl
of our tribe, and had a dozen men ready to marry her. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>married Lez, a smart young man from the Pulati side, and one
of the <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>Baryaktar’s</i></span> bodyguard, like myself. A month after
their marriage Lez was treacherously killed by his brother,
who lived down by the White Drin, and was violently in love
with her. When she received the news she became half
demented by grief. But, by slow degrees, she formed her
plans for the blood-feud, and having no male relatives, resolved
to take it on herself. She therefore left us and was absent
nearly a year, during which time she persistently followed her
brother-in-law first to Ochrida, in Macedonia, then to Skopia,
Prisrend, and many other places, always awaiting her opportunity
to strike the blow. This came one afternoon when her
husband’s assassin was walking in the main street in Skodra,
and she took Lez’s pistol from her belt and blew his face away.
It was valiant of a woman—was it not? But not only that,”
he went on. “Having killed the murderer, she went straight to
his parents’ house, three days’ journey, and shot them both
dead. Since then she has been back with us, for poor Lez’s
death has been avenged. I was sorry he died,” he added
regretfully, “for he was one of my dearest friends.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Murder is hardly a crime in Albania, for life is cheap—very
cheap. An enemy or a stranger is shot like a dog, and
left at the roadside.</p>

<p class='c001'>Palok told me of an incident which truly illustrates the
utter disregard the Albanian has for other people’s lives. He
was once with a man of the Hoti—on the Montenegrin frontier—who
had just obtained a new rifle, probably from a murdered
Turkish soldier. While he was inspecting it a man passed close
by, a stranger, whereupon the man with the new gun raised it
to his shoulder, took aim, and fired. The stranger fell dead.
Palok remonstrated, but his companion merely said that he
was testing his gun’s accuracy. Was it not better, he asked,
to test it that way, instead of waiting till face to face with an
enemy?</p>

<p class='c001'>The assassin is never punished, except by those who take
up the blood-feud. If the murder takes place in a town the
guilty one escapes to the mountains, or gets away into Macedonia,
or into Servia, where he earns his living by sawing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>firewood. Every few years the Sultan issues an irade “for
the pacification of the blood,” as it is put, and the murderer
then returns. He pays a small tax to the Turkish Government,
after which he cannot be arrested; and if he pays about three
hundred crowns to the relatives of his victim, the blood-feud
is at an end.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, of course, does not apply to the mountain tribes.
They care not a jot for the Sultan or for his irades. There is
no law—save that of the blood-feud, the vendetta falling upon
the murderer and upon his next male relative. Many were
the curious facts regarding the blood-feud and the Albanian
laws of hospitality told to me.</p>

<p class='c001'>A case in point was that of a young man named Kol, a
friend of Lûk’s, a tall, wiry youth, of somewhat sinister expression—a
typical bandit out of a book-illustration.</p>

<p class='c001'>I was talking to Lûk about the hospitality extended by
the various tribes to each other when Kol passed, and he
beckoned him, saying—</p>

<p class='c001'>“He has just had a curious experience in the Klementi
country. Let him relate it to you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So at Palok’s invitation the young fellow accepted one of
my cigarettes, placed his rifle against the wall, and flung himself
down upon a small boulder near us.</p>

<p class='c001'>He blew a cloud of smoke from his lips, stroked his knees
with his hands, and looked at me with considerable curiosity,
wondering why I should want to know his story.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The stranger is interested in your adventures with the
Klementi. Tell him all about them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bah!” he said, with a slight shrug of the shoulders. “It
was nothing—mere chance—luck, if you like to call it so.
There is nothing to tell.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But what there is interests the Englishman. He is the
<span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>Baryaktar’s</i></span> guest, remember,” Lûk remarked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well,” said the young man reluctantly, “I was in
blood-feud with a man of the Klementi, and went over there
to kill him. I laid in wait one evening, and as he drove home
his sheep I shot him from behind a rock. He had killed my
father, therefore I had a just right to avenge his blood. My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>shot, however, aroused the whole valley, and I knew that
I, the only stranger, would be suspected and killed. Therefore
I sped away down the valley in the darkness till I reached
a poor little house. An old woman was there, and I craved
food and shelter for the night. She gave me food at once—for,
like ourselves, the Klementi never send a stranger empty away.
I was hungry, for I had crossed into the Klementi region in
secret, and dared not seek food lest my presence became known
to the man I intended to kill.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Scarcely had I eaten the meat the old woman had
given me when there came the sound of voices outside,
and to my horror I saw four men carrying the body of my
victim.</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘See!’ they cried to the woman who was befriending
me. ‘One of the Skreli has killed your son!’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then I knew that it was the murdered man’s mother who
had given me shelter. A moment later the men, among whom
was the elder brother of the victim, discovered me.</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘See!’ they cried. ‘There is your son’s murderer.
We will kill him!’</p>

<p class='c001'>“I stood with my back to the wall, knowing well that
my last moment had come. The dead man’s brother raised his
rifle while I drew my pistol, prepared at least to fire once more
before I died. I was caught like a rat in a trap!</p>

<p class='c001'>“The old woman, however, seeing my position and my
helplessness, cried—</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘No. Though he has killed your brother, you may not
touch him. He is beneath our roof; he has eaten our bread,
and our protection must remain over him till to-morrow’s
sunset. Remember, my son. It is our law.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“The man dropped his rifle, and his friends drew back at
the old woman’s reproof.</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Go!’ she said to me, after glancing at her son’s body.
‘You have eaten our bread, and therefore you cannot be
harmed.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Yes, go,’ added my victim’s brother. ‘Till to-morrow’s
sundown I will not follow. But after that, I shall track you
down, and, before Heaven, I will kill you.’</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Need I say that I took up my rifle, and leaving the house
travelled quickly all night and all next day, until I returned
here? But,” added Kol, with a slight sigh, “we shall meet one
day—and he will most certainly kill me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Is there any other country in the world where such a code
of honour exists? I am inclined to think not.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had I been in the midst of a highly civilised people—a
foreigner wandering in the wilds of Yorkshire, for example—I
certainly should never have received the many charming
kindnesses that I did at the hands of those rough, uncivilised
tribes. Climbing like cats up the mountainsides as they did,
I was often compelled to lag behind, being unused to such
walking. But, laughing merrily, those armed banditti would
take me by the arms and help me up the steeper places; they
would roll cigarettes for me, carry my rifle when I grew fagged,
and fetch and carry for me like children.</p>

<p class='c001'>My neat Smith-Wesson hammerless revolver was constantly
admired, as being a much more handy and serviceable weapon
than their own big pistols—Austrian-made revolvers fitted
to antique silver butts that had once done service to flintlocks.
My Browning repeating revolver, with its magazine
holding eight cartridges, was declared a marvel of ingenuity,
and on many occasions Vatt and his men amused themselves
by firing with it at targets.</p>

<p class='c001'>Once he remarked, with a grim smile, that it would be a
handy weapon against the Turks. Where could he get one?
Was it costly?</p>

<p class='c001'>And when I promised to send him one through our mutual
friend in the bazaar down in Skodra, as souvenir of my visit,
his joy knew no bounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>A month later I fulfilled my promise, sending it across
from Sofia, and have since received an acknowledgment of
its safe receipt.</p>

<p class='c001'>I wonder whether he has yet used it against the hated
Turk? Whether or not, he no doubt struts about with it in
his belt, a greater chief than all the others, because he possesses
the very latest and deadliest of weapons.</p>

<p class='c001'>When one evening I told my host that I had still a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>way to go—through Bosnia, Herzegovina, Servia, Bulgaria,
Roumania, and Macedonia—and that I must bid him farewell,
his face fell. He seemed to genuinely regret.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But you will return soon,” he urged. “You will redeem
your promise, and bring your friends to shoot. Bring that
friend you told me about who shoots tigers in India. I want
to see what sort of shot he is. And the friend who shoots
partridges and pheasants.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I promised that I would go back to him before long.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Remember, there will be no danger—none. Tell your
friends that Vatt invites them, and that they are free to go
anywhere—anywhere,” he said, waving his hand over the
wild panorama of mountain and valley that is his indisputable
domain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next day I rose, packed my small belongings, and with
a little present to Lûk and to his pretty wife prepared to
leave, when, judge my amazement to find Vatt and his bodyguard
outside, and to hear that the chief had decided to
accompany me right down to Skodra!</p>

<p class='c001'>This indeed he did, and when we arrived in the town held
by the Turks he strutted down the main street with me,
apparently proud of his guest, and in open defiance of the
scowling ragged soldiers in dirty red fezes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though a deadly enemy of the Turks, he openly defied
them. As we walked along the streets there came close behind
us twenty of his faithful followers, armed to the teeth and
carrying their rifles ready loaded in case of trouble.</p>

<p class='c001'>But there was no trouble. The Turks of Skodra are wise
enough to let the Skreli severely alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>Trouble will, however, come one day before long, and then
alas for the subjects of the Sultan. The Albanians will avenge
the blood of the Christians now spilt daily in Macedonia, and
the Turk will be driven back southward—or at least what is
left of him.</p>

<p>My Body-guard in Northern Albania.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I parted from Vatt at the door of my so-called <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>albergo</i></span>.
He took a glass of <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>rakhi</i></span> with me, and afterwards, with a hearty
hand-grip, he told me not to forget my promise to return.
Then he left me, stalking at the head of his armed band, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>one and all wished me <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bon voyage</i></span>, and he went down the
street on his return to his mountain home.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the irony of Fate followed. A fortnight later I found
myself riding with a strong military escort on the other side
of the mountains, where I had been so hospitably entertained—along
the frontier of the Skreli country.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was growing dusk, and we were passing through a deep
ravine, our horses stumbling at every step, when of a sudden
the crack of a rifle startled us.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next instant a dozen rifles flashed fire in the deep shadows
to our left. The Skreli outposts were sniping at us!</p>

<p class='c001'>In a moment we had all dismounted and sought cover, and
for fully ten minutes returned their fire vigorously, while
the officer of the escort kept up a volley of imprecations on
the heads of my late hosts, who were, of course, in ignorance
that they were firing upon “the Englishman.” We were too
far off each other to do much harm, therefore we simply blazed
away. I was crouched behind a rock with the muzzle of my
rifle poked through a convenient crack, and fired towards the
spot where the flashes showed.</p>

<p class='c001'>A good deal of powder and bad language were expended,
until at last our friends on the other side of the valley,
apparently thinking we were too far away, ceased firing, and
we of course did the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a mutual truce. For ten minutes longer we waited
in order to see what would happen. Then, leading our horses,
we crept carefully along on our way northward, out of the
range of our friends’ guns.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those moments were exciting, however, while they lasted,
yet they were not without their grim humour.</p>

<p class='c015'>Through Dalmatia to Herzegovina—Over the Balkan watershed—Bosnia
and Sarayevo—A half-Turkish, half-Servian town—Austrian persecution
of the Christians—Some astounding facts—A land of spies and scandals—The
police as murderers—A disgrace to European civilisation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the darkest hour before daylight I bade farewell to my
friend Mr. Charles des Graz, the British Chargé d’Affaires
in Cettinje, and mounting into the pair-horse carriage, left the
Montenegrin capital to descend that most wonderfully engineered
road over the face of the bare mountains to Cattaro,
on my way to Herzegovina and Bosnia.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though still dark, Cettinje was already stirring, and as I
drove through the long main street, armed men who were my
friends saluted me, and shouted “<span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>S’bogom!</i></span>” My driver and
myself were armed too, in case of “accident,” yet the Montenegrin
roads are quite safe nowadays, thanks to the pacific and
beneficent rule of His Royal Highness Prince Nicholas.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our eight-hour journey through the mountains was full of
interest. Over those bare, tumbled limestone rocks, devoid of
herbage and wild to the extremity of desolation, came the
first rosy flush of dawn, and as we watched, the sun gradually
dispelled the greys into yellows and golds in all the glory of
the bursting of an autumn day. First, over the great plateau
on which Cettinje is situated; then up the bare face of the
mountain in a series of zigzags with acute angles; up, higher
and higher, where the wind cut one’s face like a knife; and
higher still, where we got out to walk, and so lighten the horses
and warm ourselves. I gave my driver a pull at my flask, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the temperature was below zero, and we were both cramped
and cold. Even through my leather-lined motor-coat the wind
cut like a knife, chilling me to the bone.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the summit a glorious view, one more wonderful, perhaps,
than any in the whole of the Balkans. On the one side in the
far blue distance the Accursed Mountains of Albania, where
dwelt my friend Vatt Marashi and his fearless men, and on the
other, away down in the rolling mists, lay what looked like a
series of lakes, but which in reality was the wandering arm of the
Adriatic, the magnificent fjord called the Mouths of Cattaro—the
Bocche di Cattaro.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here we struck the single telegraph-wire which places
remote Cettinje in connection with the rest of the civilised
world, and then the pace of our rough mountain horses showed
that we were descending. Far below were a number of
scattered houses, the little town of Nyegush, the chief edifice of
which is the unpretentious palace of the Prince, and for a full
hour and a half we wound down and down ere we reached
its main street and pulled up at the inn for half an hour to
get some coffee and to rest the horses.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cramped and half-frozen as I was, the big steaming bowl
of coffee was indeed welcome. Then, after scribbling some
postcards to friends in England, I went for a brisk walk, took
a photograph or two, and returned, just as the horses were being
reharnessed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Down again, ever down, past a great dark cavern, and on
until we came to the row of stone slabs set in the road that
marks the frontier between gallant little Montenegro and her
enemy Austria. And then, what a view! Surely the most
superb in all Europe!</p>

<p class='c001'>Our old familiar tourist-Switzerland, the toy-Tyrol, the
Norwegian fjords, the trumpery-Apennines, and the high
Balkans are full of magnificent scenery, but for a picturesque
combination of blue sea and sheer bare mountain nothing
that I have ever seen—and I have knocked about Europe, I
believe, as much as most men—equals that view from the
Montenegrin road.</p>

<p class='c001'>All is beautiful—all save that frowning fortress which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Austrians have lately constructed to command the road, and
which it is strictly forbidden to photograph under pain of
imprisonment as a spy. I, however, risked it, and took another
picture, which turned out rather well.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Cattaro, being the bearer of despatches for His Britannic
Majesty’s Foreign Office in London, and being therefore
armed with a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>laisser-passer</i></span>, my baggage was not examined,
and at one o’clock I again boarded the same steamer which had
brought me from Trieste, the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Graf Wurmbrand</i></span>, bound for
Gravosa—which is the port for Ragusa, in Dalmatia.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ragusa I found a quaint, mediæval place, reminding me
strongly of one of those old towns on the Italian Riviera—I
mean those unfashionable ones, at which the train stops and
nobody gets out—ones that you only visit if you are motoring
from Monte Carlo along to Genoa. It is a town of ponderous
walls, of narrow streets, and queer dark byways. Across its
dry moat and through its ancient gateway carriages do not
pass, and as soon as you are in the main street you are out
of it again, and passing through a water-gate are upon a small
quay.</p>

<p class='c001'>Difficult it is to realise that this quiet, old-world town,
where everyone speaks Italian, was once the great port of the
Balkan hinterland in the days when Venice was Queen of the
Seas. And yet to the antiquary it is pleasant to stroll in and
out of the old sixteenth-century churches, the Rector’s Palace,
and the rest, to examine the mediæval Onofrio fountain, and
to spend a day, as I did, among the architectural relics of an
age bygone and long forgotten.</p>

<p class='c001'>While there it rained for the first time after the long dry
season. And if you have ever been in Italy—or anywhere,
indeed—in the extreme south of Europe on the first day of the
rainy season, you will know what I mean when I say it was
not a mere shower. Water came down in sheets, and for a
whole day and a whole night it never ceased, while the lightning
flashed and the thunder crashed and echoed in the chain of
mountains behind the town.</p>

<p class='c001'>Palms and oranges grow in profusion in Ragusa, while
across on the beautiful island of Lacroma—which legend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>connects with Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion—is vegetation more
luxuriant than even upon the French Riviera. Prince Mirko
of Montenegro, Colonel Constantinovitch, his father-in-law,
and a number of wealthy people, mostly Austrians, have
fine winter villas outside the town, and life there in spring is
said to be quite charming.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many yachts call there during the season, and there is
opera at frequent intervals. Zara, Spalato, and Lussinpiccolo
are all favourite winter resorts of the Austrians and Hungarians,
but none is so smart or so select as Ragusa, which, by the way,
has its hotel, the Imperial, where the charges equal, if not
quite eclipse, those of the best hotels at Nice or Monte Carlo,
while the cooking is inferior.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the owner of a pretty villa overlooking the sea who
desires to spend a quiet, healthful winter, Ragusa may be
pleasant, but I confess it struck me as a particularly dull
little town—a place so full of faded glory as to be painful.</p>

<p class='c001'>The journey from Gravosa across Dalmatia, Herzegovina,
Bosnia, and Hungary to Servia I found tedious, though mostly
through fine wild mountain scenery. I performed it partly by
road and partly by rail, making Mostar and Sarayevo—the
Bosnian capital—my halting-places.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rail, a narrow-gauge one with a single train a day,
starts from Gravosa at five o’clock in the morning and first
ascends the Ombla valley from the sea. Gradually it rises in
a series of zigzags over the grey bare rocks and through many
tunnels for sixty miles to Gabela, a little mountain town,
and then through the dry beds of a series of great lakes, and
across barren plateaux until it descends into the valley of
the Narenta, which narrows into a series of dark, romantic
defiles, while the mountains grow higher and more wild, until
Mostar, the capital of Herzegovina, is reached.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mostar is a rather dull little town on the Narenta, still
half-Turkish, with its mosques and bazaar where one can
obtain inlaid silver work from Livino. But there was certainly
nothing to attract, so I pushed on next day to Sarayevo.
Between the two capitals the scenery is superb, indeed some
of the grandest in the whole of the Balkans. Through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Great Defile, or Gorge of the Narenta, the train slowly wends
its sinuous course beneath the high precipices of Velez, and
then through the Prenj Mountains, across the Glogosnica valley
to the small garrison town of Jablanica, a lonely little place
in a very wild district.</p>

<p class='c001'>Twenty miles farther on we came to Konjica, a picturesque
little place with a fine old Turkish bridge spanning the Narenta,
where the train halts, affording us time to explore the place and
take a photograph or two. Then the ascent is so steep that
the puffing little locomotive is fitted with cog-wheels to take
us through the Trescanica valley up over the ridge of the
wild Ivan Planina, the high watershed between the Black
Sea and the Adriatic.</p>

<p class='c001'>Progress is slow and halts are frequent. In places there
have been landslips, and we creep along the edges of dangerous
precipices. But the scenery fully compensates for the many
tedious hours and for lack of food—for in our ignorance I had
omitted to lay in stores, and the only thing I could obtain
during the day was half a dozen apples! The Bosnian frontier
crossed, the train traverses the saddle of Vilovac, then descends
rapidly through beautiful wooded valleys and along the Bosna
and Zeljeznica rivers, until, in the darkness, Sarayevo with its
many electric lamps is reached—a railway journey even more
interesting than the well-known Gothard route.</p>

<p class='c001'>My fellow-passengers from Mostar were two. One was a
Turkish gentleman who removed his slippers and sat cross-legged
on the seat fingering his beads until the sundown, when
he produced some sandwiches from the tail of his frock-coat, and
slowly consumed them after his long fast since four o’clock
that morning. The other was a particularly communicative
Austrian gentleman, whom I recognised at once to be a spy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sarayevo, the Bosnian capital, is very Eastern, and, being so,
is full of attraction for the stranger. There is a very fair
old-fashioned hotel, the Europa, in the centre of the town,
nearly two miles from the station. It is a city of mosques,
the minarets of which were all gaily illuminated on the night
of my arrival, producing a picturesque effect against the
night-sky.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The place is prettily situated—a town of some forty
thousand inhabitants, half Serb, half Eastern. Lying in the
narrow valley, whence the river Milyacka bursts forth from a
gorge just above the town, the dwellers by the riverside are
mostly Austrian immigrants, while the natives have their
houses and their mosques on the hillside. Every house has
its own little garden, as in Servia, and of course the bazaar
is the centre of trade, as in every town where the beslippered
Turk still remains.</p>

<p class='c001'>This <span lang="bs" xml:lang="bs"><i>charshiya</i></span>, or bazaar, is a great labyrinth of dark,
narrow, ill-paved alleys flanked with booths, where every
trade, each with its particular quarter, is carried on in open
view to the passers-by. The copper ware, silver filigree, and
carpets are attractive, but most of the so-called Oriental goods
are “fakes.” The place, though there is a variety of costume
everywhere, is not half so attractive as Skodra, because of the
Austrian bogey that pervades everything.</p>

<p class='c001'>To buy specimens of Bosnian chiselled metal work it is
best to go to the Government School of Industrial Art, where
the finest pieces of workmanship may be seen in course of
execution, and where the price asked is a fixed one, below that
demanded either in the bazaar or in shops. The services for
Turkish coffee in chiselled copper-gilt are of chaste and very
elegant design, perfect marvels of patience in chiselling, and
very appreciable to the Western taste in decorative art.</p>

<p class='c001'>The chief feature of the bazaar is the Husref Beg Mosque,
the finest in the town, to which, though an Infidel, I was
granted admission. I of course put on overshoes, and made
an interesting tour round with a priest who only spoke Turkish,
so that I did not learn very much from him. Built about
1540, it is a fine spacious structure, with dome and high minarets,
and in front, in the quiet old courtyard, is a fine old fountain
for ablutions shaded by a very ancient lime tree. Before it,
sit several Turkish pedlars in turbans selling rosaries, printed
texts from the Koran, imitation otto-of-rose manufactured
from geranium, European collar-studs, and other trifles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another industry peculiar to Bosnia is the inlay of gold
and silver into bog-oak, or gun-metal, and many quaint little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>objects—boxes, bracelets, brooches, and belt-buckles—quite
unique in England, may be purchased. The old silver filigree
buttons displayed everywhere may also be used with advantage
by ladies for hat-pins.</p>

<p class='c001'>A stroll through the town shows at once the mixed character
of the people, for all the names of streets are written up in
three languages—Turkish, Croatian, and Serb. The noisy
thoroughfares are crowded with Europeans, mixed up with
baggy-legged men and veiled women, men in fezes in all stages
of disintegration, while the Bosnian ladies wear the queerest
head-gear I have ever set eyes upon. The hair is parted in
the middle and brushed down straight, while upon it is stuck a
tiny pork-pie cap of gaudy-coloured chintz or silk, edged with a
thousand gilt sequins sewn closely together, the most ugly and
most unbecoming head-dress imaginable. Yet it is evidently
the <em>mode</em>, and is worn by European ladies in all other respects
attired as one would find them in Vienna or in Budapest.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this is Bosnia, and assuredly strange things happen
here under the unjust rule of Austria.</p>

<p class='c001'>Strangers seldom come to Sarayevo. In the heart of that
mountainous region between the Save and the Adriatic, only
approached from the south by that rack-and-pinion railway,
or from the north by the one train a day from that un-get-at-able
station in Slavonia, Bosnche-Brod, it is entirely shut
away from European influence—or European eyes, for the
matter of that—and quite off the track taken by strangers in
the Balkans.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, I would never advise the intending traveller to
take that route from Ragusa to Belgrade. Better by far take
the steamer right up the Adriatic to Fiume, and thence by rail,
as it is quicker, and much less fatiguing. I did not go to
Bosnia, however, so much to see its capital as to obtain some
idea of the present system of government there, and to hear
from the lips of the people themselves the advantages, or
disadvantages, of the rule of His Majesty the Emperor Francis
Josef.</p>

<p class='c001'>With many well-known men in Sarayevo I talked. I heard
both sides. But I am bound to admit that some of the facts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>proved to me were utterly amazing, showing how ill and unjustly
governed is both Bosnia and Herzegovina. I had read
André Barre’s recent book, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>La Bosnie-Herzegovina</cite></span>, and had
doubted the very serious and direct charges which he brings
against the Austrian Administration.</p>

<p class='c001'>Therefore I went to see for myself, to make inquiry, and
to thoroughly investigate.</p>

<p class='c001'>The opinion I formed, after analysing the many facts
placed before me, is that the present oppressed state of Bosnia
is surely a vivid object-lesson to Servia, where day by day
Austria is endeavouring, by the most ingenious and unscrupulous
forms of intrigue, to obtain a footing. This latter I will
explain more fully in my chapters on the future of Servia.
Suffice it here to say that poor struggling Bosnia is to-day
helpless beneath the talons of the Austrian eagle, and that the
administration is a shameful travesty of civilised rule.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Serb population are more essentially the sufferers,
and have been so ever since the Austrian occupation allowed
by the Treaty of Berlin. Through the four centuries of the
Turkish rule, the Christians were from time to time oppressed,
and in return revolted, more particularly in 1850 and 1875;
but the position of the Serbs to-day is very little better, if any,
than it was before the Russo-Turkish War.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, it seems that the whole policy of Austria in Bosnia
has been directed against the Servian Orthodox people. The
Servian Mohammedans are not feared because of their
ignorance, while their fatalism renders them docile. On the
contrary, however, the local Government of Bosnia fears those
professing the Orthodox faith, and, having established the
Jesuits solidly in the country, have proceeded upon a course
of systematic persecution. Austrian methods are too apparent
all over the Balkans. Unscrupulous to a degree, her policy
in Bosnia has been one of terror, of espionage, of famine, and
of assassination. In truth it is accomplishing the moral and
material ruin of a splendid country, the crushing of the noble
Servian race which has, alas! fallen beneath its hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first I was inclined to doubt. The Serb is a patriot,
sometimes given to exaggeration. But very quickly, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>result of my inquiries, evidences of Austria’s evil rule were
apparent on every hand. To go into a mass of detail is not
within the province of this record of inquiry, neither do I wish
to scream hysterical condemnations. I went to the Balkans,
not for sight-seeing, but seeking to penetrate some of the
mysteries of their politics, and their aims for the future. I
travelled there in order to have audiences with the Kings,
Princes, and Cabinet Ministers of the various countries in
the Peninsula. These were granted me, and thus I obtained,
at first hand, their views regarding the present situation, and
their hopes and aspirations.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Bosnia, both on the Mohammedan and Christian side, I
found only a grave and grim story of misrule and oppression,
which it may be well to briefly outline, in order to show how
Austria rules the unfortunate country that falls beneath her
dominion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Under Austria, the Servian Orthodox Church is treated in
a manner utterly inconceivable in this enlightened century.
Neither trouble nor intrigue has been spared to separate the
people from the Church. The metropolitans nominated by the
Emperor have been alienated from the people, with the result
that at Mostar the head of the Church is the object of unanimous
derision. No one will attend his church if he is present, and
on passing him in the streets they turn their heads or hiss.
Again, in Sarayevo the metropolitan is regarded with equal
disfavour. The old people refuse to receive the communion
at his hands, and each day upon the walls of his house are
posted insulting placards. To those who know the veneration
with which the Serbs regard their metropolitans, such signs as
these show the general demoralisation brought about by
intrigue and the circulation of base calumnies. Not only are
the people encouraged to treat the heads of the Church with
contempt, but they are taught to hate the priests and to scoff
at religion. And this by an Empire which has the miserable
effrontery to call itself Christian!</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, Saint Sava is, as is well known, the patron saint
of the Servian Church. He is considered the protector of
churches and schools, and all new churches in Bosnia and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Herzegovina adopt for their <span lang="bs" xml:lang="bs"><i>slava</i></span>, or festival, the day
consecrated to Saint Sava, January 14 (O.S.). This day the
Orthodox Serbs everywhere regard as a feast. In the morning
there is a solemn service, and in the evening the young people
assemble to sing national songs and dance national dances.
But even this has been disapproved of by Austria, who regards
the feast as preserving the national conscience. The Government
commenced by prohibiting the second portion of the
fête, and then gradually suppressing the first. Pressed by
the authorities, the priests each 14th of January are suddenly
taken so ill that they cannot perform the service, or else they
are unavoidably absent from home on that day, so that no
<span lang="bs" xml:lang="bs"><i>slava</i></span> can take place. In this oppressed country every
programme of a fête, no matter what, must first pass the
censor, who prohibits the singing of the old Servian songs, and
places a penalty upon anyone singing the “Hymn of Saint
Sava,” which is purely a religious one. Again, in many cases
the reply of the censor will arrive eight or ten days after the
date of the festival. Indeed, in many places, the <span lang="bs" xml:lang="bs"><i>slava</i></span>
of private families—the domestic name-day feast which, to
the Servian, surpasses in interest either Christmas or Easter—has
actually been prohibited by the very enlightened local
authorities! This happened in the arrondissement of Rielinski
quite recently.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the history of the struggle of the Orthodox Church in
Bosnia, or of the strenuous Catholic propaganda, it is unnecessary
to speak. Let us deal with the present deplorable
state of affairs, and with the future. Woe-betide any heard
singing the patriotic song of the Prince of Montenegro, “Onamo
... Onamo,” for he will be punished severely. Spies are on
every hand, and no man knows at any moment when he may
be thrown into prison upon some fictitious charge. Austria,
indeed, is endeavouring to civilise and subject Bosnia by
continued oppression, and nowhere is this more apparent than
in the Press. Like in Russia, every word is subjected to the
censor before printed. One buys the <span lang="bs" xml:lang="bs"><i>Musavat</i></span>—the organ of
the Serb Mohammedans in Herzegovina, printed at Mostar—and
finds every paragraph bearing a number. There are many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>numbers with the spaces blank—suppressed altogether.
Again, in the <cite>Servian Word</cite>, the organ of the Servian Orthodox
in Bosnia, one finds the same thing—numbers and blanks.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is not, perhaps, surprising when practically every
organ of the Press is prohibited save the Government publications,
of which the <span lang="bs" xml:lang="bs"><cite>Bosniak</cite></span>—an amusing journal fabricated by
amateur journalistic functionaries of the State—is a good
example.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the hundred and four journals prohibited are most
of the Servian newspapers, even commercial, religious, and
literary reviews; a number of Hungarian journals, including
the <span lang="bs" xml:lang="bs"><cite>Dubrovnik</cite></span> of Ragusa; every Russian journal of whatever
kind or description; and last, but surely not least, the <cite>Comments
upon the Evangelists</cite> by the Metropolitan Firmilien!</p>

<p class='c001'>Every book or newspaper entering Bosnia or Herzegovina
goes through the censor’s office, while the postal employés
note, and hand to the police, the names and addresses of the
receivers of prohibited publications. So it is not only in
Russia and Turkey where one cannot read a foreign journal,
but here, under the enlightened rule of His Majesty the
Emperor Francis Josef.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bosnia is, truth to tell, an unknown land as far as the
rest of Europe is concerned, and probably these facts may
come as a complete surprise to English readers, who are apt to
regard Austria as a Christian and progressive Power, instead
of what she is, the Ogre of the Balkans.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the injustices inflicted upon the peasantry, to their
many grievances and their violated rights, I have not space here
to refer. Under such rule as pertains, the wretched condition
of the Serbs in the rural districts may well be imagined. As
André Barre has truly said, “Austria entered Bosnia and
Herzegovina, not for the purposes of reform, nor to civilise,
but to satisfy a political desire, a military ambition to triumph
over a people by slowly and methodically exterminating
them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“J’ai mis le pied sur la tête du serpent,” said Count
Andrassy, speaking to Lord Salisbury after the signature of
the Treaty of Berlin. And those words give to-day the key to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the Austrian policy. She seeks to crush the Serbs, not only in
Bosnia, but in the kingdom of Servia itself, and to Germanise
the whole land by steel and by hunger. And such is the
present pitiable situation—a situation unrealised in England—a
situation which has actually called forth the hostile
criticism of the Vienna journals themselves—including the
semi-official <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Neue Freie Presse</cite></span>—against the present barbarism
of the occupation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Any industry or commerce exploited by Serbs is at once
crushed and ruined, while in the police we have vivid examples
of corrupt maladministration only equalled in Russia. The
police persecutions are scandalous. Many were related to me
by persons who had themselves been victims. The Bosnian
citizen beneath the claws of the police is utterly without
defence. If the paternal Government of Austria attempt to
deny this, let the recent cases of M. Gligorie Jeftanovitch of
Sarayevo, M. Chola of Mostar, M. Stiepo Srchkitch, M. Ilia
Duckovitch, M. Risto Maximovitch, M. Radoulovitch, M.
Nikolas Pichkakutch of Banja-Louka, and the sad affair of
Pierre Dorliatcha of Bosnia-Novi, amid a thousand others, be
cited, to show what travesties of justice are performed in this
remote corner of the Balkans. A whole volume, indeed, could
be written upon the corrupt Austrian police methods which
vie with those of Holy Russia. But it must suffice here to
cite cases upon which no denial can be offered by the authorities.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Austrian authorities, who are so glib with their semi-official
denials and statements, which we see almost daily in
the London newspapers, will have some difficulty in disproving
the disgraceful incident at Sokolatz, near Sarayevo, not long
ago. Here, during the Easter fête, the gendarmes were formed
round the church “to maintain order.” A peasant saw one of
the gendarmes endeavouring to outrage a young woman, and
ran to inform the authorities. Whereupon the gendarme
shot the peasant dead with his revolver. There was no inquiry
regarding the murder, though witnessed by at least a hundred
persons. And the official account of the affair—which I have
myself seen—actually declares that the unfortunate peasant
died <em>a natural death</em>!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>This is but one single case of hundreds. All over the
country the police and gendarmes shoot the witnesses of their
crimes, and there is never an inquiry. Of a verity the barbarities
of the police in Bosnia are a disgrace to a nation that
calls itself civilised, and cry for reform quite as loudly as they
do in the Land of the Tzar.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the reader who doubts this outspoken condemnation of
Austrian administration go to Bosnia and see for himself. He
will find that I have understated the facts, and things will be
told him that surely will stagger belief.</p>

own experience—Fighting the spy with his own weapons—To “nobble”
the foreigner—How an unfavourable book was purchased by the
Austrian Government—Bribery of Press correspondents—A country
worse than Russia—Some suggested reforms—The secret policy of
Austria in the Balkans.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spies are a necessity to autocratic Governments. Their
business is to prevent the execution of plots, to discover
all secrets affecting the security of the Prince or the State, and
to supply information which may be used with advantage in
diplomacy by their employers.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Bosnia one of the largest items in the national expenditure
is the sum expended upon espionage. Here, however, its
character is very different from that described above. Its agents
have no work in connection with political plots, for the crushed
and humiliated people are far too feeble to conspire against
the State. Their nefarious work is simply to spread intimidation
and suspicion among the inhabitants, and to put them in
defiance one against the other—indeed, to promote disorder,
so that the force of Austria may be consolidated upon them.</p>

<p class='c001'>This secret stirring up of internal strife by Austria is part
of her policy, not only in Bosnia but in Servia and other parts
of the Balkans. In the kingdom of Servia she is especially
active to-day. Indeed, her unscrupulous methods are well
illustrated by what occurred on the assassination of King
Alexander and Queen Draga. Instantly after the assassination
Austria mobilised her troops in all the garrisons on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Servian frontier, at Semlin, Pancsova, and Neusatz, with orders
to enter Servian territory on the first sign of trouble. At the
same time there was sent into Belgrade a perfect army of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>agents provocateurs</i></span>—police spies, all of them—who promenaded
the town crying to the crowd, “Come on! Come on! Let
us wreck and demolish the Embassy of Austria, the supporters
of the dynasty of Obrenovitch!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Servian people, fortunately, hesitated, though they all
had good cause to make a demonstration against their bitterest
enemies. Then the Minister of the Interior intervened, and
put military guards at all the Legations. The agitators were
arrested, and at their trial were proved beyond doubt to be
actual agents of Austria, sent there to create disorder and so
allow the Austrian troops to enter Servia!</p>

<p class='c001'>And as such, with a strong protest to Vienna, they were
ignominiously expelled.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Sarayevo one half of the population is paid to spy upon
the other half. Ask any man in Bosnia or in Herzegovina
his opinion of his neighbour, and he will tell you to beware of
him, as “he is a spy, and will denounce you to the authorities.”
Ask the accused about his accuser, and he will tell you exactly
the same thing. The whole place simply swarms with secret
agents. In the country, peasants are given cows in payment
for information about their neighbours, which is, of course, very
often false. Stories are manufactured for the sake of reward.
Expense is nothing. Agents follow you everywhere—in the
town, in the country, and even beyond the frontier.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oh yes! Bosnia, with all her natural beauties of scenery,
is a truly delightful place under the present régime. The
Government have their spies in private houses in the guise of
domestics—for, by preference, they employ women and priests.
Every pavement in the towns carries a spy, therefore silence
here is certainly golden. The spy system is more complete and
elaborate than either in Russia or in France, and a good deal
more costly—all energies being devoted against the unfortunate
Serbs.</p>

<p class='c001'>In such an oppressed and persecuted country it goes without
saying that the stranger is well looked after. From the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>moment I crossed the frontier of Herzegovina, to the moment
I left Slavonia at Zimony, I was never lost sight of. Perhaps
because I was known to be the bearer of Government despatches,
I was suspected of being a British agent in disguise. My
passport was never asked for until I desired to leave Austrian
territory and cross the Save to Belgrade, yet with the marvellous
secret system I was, while in Bosnia, a marked man. Each
time I strolled in the streets of Mostar or of Sarayevo, a spy
dogged my footsteps—sometimes a man, sometimes a woman—and
my every movement was carefully noted.</p>

<p class='c001'>A gentleman, apparently staying in the hotel and speaking
excellent French, volunteered to be my guide about Sarayevo.
He was a pleasant, nonchalant fellow, and represented himself
to be a commercial traveller. I accepted his kind offices, well
knowing him to be a spy, and was rather amused at the idea of
the authorities providing me gratuitously with such an excellent
cicerone. Wherever I went, so also did he. By all kinds of
clever ruses he endeavoured to discover the reason of my visit;
and I, in order to aggravate him, managed to elude his questions
and so increase his suspicions. In my travels in various
out-of-the-world corners of the Continent I have had a wide
experience of spies and their ways, therefore I set myself to
puzzle my inquisitive friend by adopting the self-same methods
as he himself was adopting.</p>

<p class='c001'>This continued for a couple of days, when he gave me up
and disappeared. After that I was watched by two agents,
who kept me always under close surveillance. I was more
amused than annoyed, yet I confess I entertained constant
anxiety regarding the confidential despatches that were in my
possession, to be handed over to the King’s Messenger on his
way from Constantinople to London at the earliest moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The traveller can only reach Sarayevo from three points:
from the north from Bosnche-Brod or Banja-Louka, and
from the south by Metkovitch. The local authorities of these
three places know each traveller who passes, and to the
stranger’s compartment there enters a pleasant person of
engaging manner, who becomes his fellow-traveller, whiles away
the tedious hours, explains the objects of interest along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>route, and at the same time discovers a good deal about the
new-comer. The secret agent will discourse upon the peace of
the country, the prosperity of the people, the impartiality
of the administration, and the rapid strides of progress being
made on every hand. Meanwhile, news of the stranger has
been telegraphed to Sarayevo, and when the polite traveller
has parted from the stranger, the latter at once falls under a
strict surveillance, of which he never dreams.</p>

<p class='c001'>Should you let drop the remark that you have come to
Bosnia to study the conditions of the country, then the attention
paid to you will be prodigious. Kind friends, overflowing
with information, will be your guides everywhere: they will
conduct you to visit the authorities; they will pay for your
cabs, give you luncheons at restaurants, and accompany you
of an evening even to the door of your bedroom, until you will
think the country a veritable El Dorado. Strangers who come
to study are, of course, dangerous to the Administration, and
therefore are carefully watched, and treated with unsurpassing
generosity. Spies surround him, and the people, knowing
those spies by sight, fear to approach him. In some cases a
peasant or a citizen has approached a stranger and told him
some plain truths—the truths I have learnt and written in
these pages—and for doing so has invariably been sent to
prison. These lessons have borne fruit, for nowadays nothing
in the world will induce the Bosnian peasant to talk to a
stranger. He is far too afraid.</p>

<p class='c001'>If any serious criticism of Bosnian administration is
published abroad, the authorities always seek to immediately
purchase and suppress it, and many are the sums yearly paid
in blackmail to unscrupulous writers who, knowing the truth,
threaten to make exposure. I will give a case in point. Not
very long ago there was in Prague published a brochure
severely criticising the Bosnian policy, giving a description
of the maladministration, and pointing out the disastrous
state of the finances. A copy of this fell into the hands of
M. Stakievitch, late director of the administration of the
Bosnian local Government, and at that moment <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en congé</i></span>.
He at once apprised the local Government, who immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>sent Dr. Berx to Prague, with orders to suppress the publication
of the book at all costs. The Government, after some brief
negotiations, paid the sum of 100,000 florins (200,000 fcs.) for
the destruction of the book and the silence of its author upon
the state of Bosnian finance!</p>

<p class='c001'>Then on the return of Dr. Berx no fewer than forty functionaries
were arrested on charges of having given information
to the author. Is not this sufficiently significant? Every
newspaper in Bosnia and Herzegovina is well subsidised, and
in return is compelled to chant the praises of the administration
of the local Government, while all correspondents of foreign
journals are equally the recipient of money from the State. In
Bosnia the foreign newspaper correspondent lives well and
grows fat.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus does Austria throw dust in the eyes of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>With religion persecuted, education at a standstill, and
the Press either gagged or suborned, Austria is slowly carrying
out her policy of crushing the Serbs. In Bosnia you have no
right to pray, no right to think; you must blindly obey and
laud with flattery the very talons outstretched to rend you.
It is a land where justice is a farce, where lies are told as truths,
where the police persecute and murder, where the poor are
oppressed, where the official grows wealthy, and where no
man is secure from the false denunciation of spies eager for
reward.</p>

<p class='c001'>Should it be permitted in this twentieth century to one
European people to crush another European people under the
false pretext of civilisation? The Bosnians are neither
negroes nor red-skins, but a civilised religious race, part of
the great Serb nation, with the same right to live, the same
right to religion, liberty, and to justice as the canting
hypocrites of Vienna themselves. Why should they be
exterminated?</p>

<p class='c001'>So careful is the local Government of Bosnia not to allow
the truth to leak out that up to the present little has been
heard in Europe of the plain, unvarnished facts I have here
put forward. But it is a subject that will come before the
public ere long, and then we shall see if the Powers will still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>stand by and allow the destruction of a people who do not merit
the hatred of their master.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>In Herzegovina.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Bosnia and Herzegovina are both rich countries; the soil
is productive, the inhabitants are intelligent and apt in agriculture,
industry, and commerce. The provinces are capable
of moral and material expansion, if such were permitted, and
there is no reason why the whole country should not be peaceable
and prosperous.</p>

<p class='c001'>Save André Barre, scarcely a writer has up to to-day had
the courage to frankly criticise the rule of His Imperial and
Royal Majesty the Emperor of Austria. So carefully are the
facts concealed by the local authorities—who adopt the
self-same tactics of Russia before the uprising—that strangers
going to Bosnia see or hear practically nothing, and what they
do see is all rose-tinted. What I have written here is, however,
based upon my own observations, and upon what was told and
proved to me by responsible persons in Mostar and Sarayevo,
men who, living under the persecution of police and Government,
risked their liberty in speaking with me. I have therefore
put the facts plainly, in order that the English reading
public may form their own conclusions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reforms urgently needed are many.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the religious point of view, what is required is
effective liberty of conscience, liberty of the cult, and the
autonomy of the Serb Orthodox Church. From the moral
point of view, the religions and customs of the different nationalities
in Bosnia should be respected, liberty of education
should be given as well as liberty of speech and liberty of the
Press.</p>

<p class='c001'>Regarded from an economic point of view, an immediate
solution of the agrarian question is required; a readjustment
of the unjust taxes; the establishment of schools of agriculture,
as in Servia and Bulgaria; liberty of commerce and industry;
and the establishment of poor-relief and poor-houses.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many reforms are also required in the Administration.
The citizens of the two countries should be eligible for employment
in public offices; the public functionaries should be replaced
by a more educated class; the police force should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>purged and diminished; the costly spy system should be
entirely abolished; a less corrupt justice should be introduced,
and economy effected in the present wasted finances.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet how can one hope for reforms from a nation like
Austria, who is working daily and unscrupulously to crush and
exterminate the unfortunate Serbs under their rule, with one
aim and one policy, namely, to extend their territory south
through Novi-Bazar and Macedonia in order to obtain the
port of Salonica?</p>

<p class='c001'>Under the Treaty of Berlin the Powers have a right to
interfere. If they would check Austria’s advances southward
they should step in at once and claim, in the name of civilisation
and humanity, justice for poor persecuted Bosnia. If half
a dozen African negroes are maltreated by a Belgian rubber-hunter
we throw up our hands in pious horror, lift our eyes
heavenward, the papers are flooded with “atrocities,” often
manufactured, and questions are asked in the House. Yet
when we have here a whole country being vigorously and
secretly crushed under our very noses, by a Power who intends
to be one of our rivals in the East, we turn our heads in the
opposite direction. Austria, we say, is a Christian country,
and can do no wrong!</p>

<p class='c001'>Go to the Balkans, and you will see what I have seen. You
will then realise the clever, subtle influence of Austrian agents
in Montenegro—where they persuade the pride of the country
to emigrate, themselves paying the expenses, and thus sap
the nation of its future population; in Northern Albania,
where the priests in Austrian pay never cease to descant upon
the benefits of Austrian rule; in Servia, where they are ever
stirring strife; in Bulgaria, where their spies are ever active;
and in Macedonia, where they secretly encourage the Greek
bands to massacre the Bulgars.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus over the whole of the Balkans Austria has spread
forth her wings, and her dark, threatening shadow is now
across everything. The Austrian policy, shown so very
plainly to all who travel in the Balkans, is to compete with
Germany and become the paramount Power in the Peninsula,
and obtain Montenegro, Albania, and Macedonia for herself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>together with the much-coveted port of Salonica. From this
latter point she already has a railway—constructed by the
late Baron Hirsch—through Usküb, and joining the main
Vienna-Constantinople line at Nisch, in Servia. Therefore
part of the policy is to lay hold of the kingdom of Servia—though
under the present régime there, and with a Government
so firmly established as it is, there is, I think, very little
to fear in this latter. Fortunately, Servia knows how to take
care of herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such is the programme of Austria—one of extermination
and extension. And with these facts in view, indisputable to
every traveller, surely it is in the interests of the Powers to
remain no longer indifferent to the state of affairs in Bosnia.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it possible that the prophetic words of the Russian
delegate Gortchakoff, speaking at the Berlin Congress, will ever
come true, as so many of his prophecies have done?</p>

<p class='c001'>He said, “The tomb of Austria is in the Balkans.”</p>

intrigue—113 known foreign spies in Belgrade!—An
illustration of the work of secret agents—Quaint Servian customs—Pauperism
unknown—Servia to-day and to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stranger’s first impression of Belgrade is that it is a
rather dull Russian town.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coming from Bosnia and Albania, one misses the quaint
costumes and the life and movement in the streets, the fierce
men with rifles, and the veiled shuffling women. The Turk,
though he has a mosque here, is unseen.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Semlin—or Zimony, as the Hungarians call it—the
last town on the Austrian side of the Save, one’s passport is
carefully examined and registered, not by the Servians, to
allow you into the country, but by the Austrians, to allow you
to pass out!</p>

<p class='c001'>As bearer of despatches for His Britannic Majesty’s Government,
I had no difficulty either with passport or luggage;
otherwise, with the Customs War raging, I might have suffered
considerable delay. Crossing the river, I ere long found myself
in comfortable quarters in the Grand Hotel in Belgrade—comfortable
indeed after the rough life and hard fare in
Northern Albania.</p>

<p class='c001'>My letters of introduction having been presented to the
Servian Cabinet Ministers and members of both political
parties, and having called upon Mr. Beethom Whitehead, the
newly appointed British Minister, I quickly found myself in
the centre of a very smart and merry diplomatic circle.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>To His Excellency M. Nicholas Pachitch,—the Premier and
strongest man in Servia; to Madame Pachitch; to His
Excellency Dr. Milenko Vesnitch, Minister of Justice; to
Madame Vesnitch, an American and one of the most charming
and beautiful ladies in Belgrade; to M. Stoyanovitch,
Minister of Commerce; to Commandant Yossiphovitch,
aide-de-camp to His Majesty; to Colonel Tcholak-Antich,
the Royal Marechal; to the Minister of Finance; to
M. Drago Yankovitch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs;
to Mr. Alexander Yovitchitch, late Servian Minister in
London; to Colonel Christich, his wife, an Irish lady, and
Miss Annie Christich; to Mr. C. L. Blakeney of the British
Legation; and also to Mr. Beethom Whitehead, the British
Minister, and Mrs. Whitehead, I owe a deep debt of
gratitude for their kindness to me socially, and their invaluable
assistance during my inquiries.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are but few English in Belgrade—not more than two
or three residents. But at the hotel I was fortunate in finding
my friend Mr. A. M. Tucker, Servian Consul-General in London,
who with his wife was in Belgrade in connection with a
financial undertaking. Mr. Tucker is an official who has
rendered many services to the Servian Government.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moving in the official set, I was soon able to see for myself
the social life in Belgrade, which I found very bright and very
entertaining. In the mornings the streets are filled with
well-dressed ladies and gallant officers, in perhaps the smartest
uniforms in Europe. The hour of the siesta is from one till
three, then at five the cafés overflow till seven. Someone is
always giving a dinner or reception, and bridge is played
everywhere; for in no other city in Europe has it “caught
on” more than it has in Belgrade.</p>

<p class='c001'>The British Legation is, of course, the smartest house
among those of the diplomatists, and that of Madame Vesnitch
among the Cabinet Ministers. French and Italian are the
languages spoken in society.</p>

<div id='i120'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_120fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Prime Minister of Servia.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The city of Belgrade is in a transition state. Already in
many of the principal streets fine new buildings have been
completed, and many are now in the course of construction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The roads, it must be said, are execrably paved, so uneven
that driving is a torture. But the reason they have not been
repaved during the present régime is because a new drainage
system is about to be carried out, and when this is done they
will be asphalted and converted into boulevards. The natural
situation of “Beograd”—or the White Fortress—is magnificent,
high up on a hill at the junction of the Save and the
Danube. Behind rises the extinct volcano of Avala, where,
according to one tradition, a great treasure is hidden, and to
another that the mountain is rich in gold and silver deposits.</p>

<p class='c001'>The centre of life in Belgrade is the gay café of the Grand
Hotel. From five to seven in the afternoon everyone is there,
card-playing, smoking, sipping <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>slivovitza</i></span> (plum gin) or drinking
<em>bock</em>, and listening to the excellent band, while the inner hall is
filled with smart ladies and their cavaliers. Save the peasantry
one sees about the street, the oxen drawing primitive carts,
and now and then a man wearing a fez, there is little that
is Eastern in Belgrade, save the slightly dark complexion
and cast of features of the Servians. For the most part the
women are very handsome, but they seem, like most Eastern
races, to lose their beauty at an early age.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though I made it my duty to hear and study both sides
of political questions in Belgrade, and though I spent many
hours with those in fierce opposition to the present régime,
I must say that I received on every hand the greatest kindness,
while everybody seemed ever ready to render me a service.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Servians are a highly intelligent and thoughtful race.
The young officers in the streets are not of the ogling, giggling
genus one knows so well in Germany, France, and Italy, but
though smarter in appearance than either nation, they are
serious, polite, and gentlemanly to a degree. The King, when
speaking to me of military matters, pointed out a curious fact,
namely, that so intelligent was the average Servian recruit
that in six months he usually learnt what in France took him
eighteen months.</p>

<p class='c001'>In feminine circles it struck me that there was a great
extravagance in dress. I saw the very latest Paris hats and
smart, well-cut gowns, which bore evidence of the expensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>couturière</i></span> worn by the wives of struggling officials, and I
learnt that about ten pounds was no uncommon price for a
hat. All classes seem to vie with each other to dress well, and
in the brilliant salons at night one sees some of the smartest
gowns in Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards cooking, I fear I cannot say very much that is
favourable. That at the Grand is decidedly poor, save perhaps
the dishes of delicious sterlet; and of the various restaurants
I tried, the only one which reached excellence was that kept
by an Italian, one Perolo, who was for many years chef to
King Milan. There one can dine well—if one knows what to
order. The younger diplomatists dine there in a room
together, entrance to which is forbidden, save to a few chosen
ones.</p>

<p class='c001'>The diplomatic circle do a good deal of entertaining. The
British Minister and his wife give large dinner-parties every
Tuesday, which are very delightful functions; while each
Thursday afternoon Mrs. Whitehead—who is a very charming
hostess—is at home. The Foreign Office have certainly been
happy in their choice of Mr. Whitehead to fulfil the very
difficult and onerous task of renewing diplomatic relations, for
he is a skilled diplomatist, and has been for many years in
St. Petersburg, Brussels, Tokio, Constantinople, and Berlin,
where he was, until recently, Councillor of Embassy. He
also speaks Russian.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Legation is one of the most tasteful houses in Belgrade,
and is filled with highly interesting collections from Japan.
The German Minister, Prince Max Ratibor, with his wife and
stepdaughter, the young Princess Taxis, also give a good many
smart entertainments.</p>

<p class='c001'>The capital is, of course, a hotbed of political intrigue,
and all foreigners arriving are suspected of being secret agents.
They are watched, their correspondence often opened, and
their business in Belgrade thoroughly investigated and reported
upon. At first the stranger resents this kind of thing. On my
arrival I found myself constantly watched, but as soon as it
was known who and what I was, the surveillance ceased.</p>

<p class='c001'>I mentioned the matter to one of the high police officials,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>whereupon he explained that in Belgrade alone he held a list of
no fewer than 113 known secret agents of Austria! “We
therefore keep secret agents for our own protection. Can you
blame us?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the diplomatic circle one hears everywhere a cry of
“shame” upon the false news which, being supposed to emanate
from reliable sources in Belgrade, is really manufactured across
the Save at Zimony by irresponsible journalists in the pay of
Austria. The Servian officials actually gave me the names of
some of these gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the English newspapers one reads constantly telegrams
from Vienna, generally to that very irresponsible and sensational
journal the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Zeit</i></span>, declaring that there are all sorts of plots in
Servia against King Peter. A short time ago this journal
actually had the audacity to say that the Crown Prince was
insane! Such telegrams should be read with entire disbelief,
for they emanate from certain Hungarian journalists who were
expelled from Belgrade on account of the false news despatched
from there, and now live across the river at Zimony, whence
they continually launch their tirades against Servia and the
Servians.</p>

<p class='c001'>What I read from time to time in the English papers
regarding Servia is so utterly opposed to the truth—and in our
most responsible journals, too—that it often utterly amazes me.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a scheme on foot started by an English company
to build a large new hotel in Belgrade—which is badly wanted.
The Grand is full to overflowing all the year round, and
strangers are nightly turned away. It is, I believe, intended
to build the hotel on English lines, with a few private sitting-rooms
where the traveller can be quiet and rest in peace away
from the turmoil and clatter inseparable from a huge garish
café.</p>

<p class='c001'>The streets are usually broad, straight, and if not actually
handsome thoroughfares, are well adapted for improvement
and the erection of larger buildings. Most of the suburban
houses are of a ground floor only, which strike the Englishman
as curious; for as the windows are on a level with the street,
there is an utter lack of privacy in family life. Servians of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>both sexes, I noticed, are great cigarette-smokers, and Servian
cigarettes I found were the best in the Balkans.</p>

<p class='c001'>The pleasantest promenade is the Kalemegdan, the pretty
gardens situated behind the old fortress which commands the
junction of the Danube and the Save, while on the bank rises
the Neboyscha (the fearless) tower, of which many terrible tales
are told of the days of the Turks. In the Kalemegdan, adorned
with bronze busts of Servian poets and savants, smart Belgrade
promenades every afternoon and admires the beautiful view
from the Fikir-Bair (“the slope of dreaming”), the smart
uniforms of the officers lending the necessary touch of colour
to complete a charming scene.</p>

<p class='c001'>The religion is, of course, Greek Orthodox, with the independent
Servian Church, while the population of Servia is
about three millions. Some of the characteristic traits of
the Servians are curious and interesting. Every Servian
family has, each year, its saint’s day, and in every Servian
drawing-room one finds a small wood panel with the image of
that saint painted thereon. The day usually falls upon that
of some great fête such as that of St. Nicholas, the Archangel
Michael, etc., which are perhaps the two most fêted. The
day in question is called the <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>Slava</i></span> (fête of the patron saint
of the family). The saint fêted by the head of the family is
also fêted by his wife, children, and servants.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some days before the fête the priest visits the house for
the benediction of water placed in a basin, after which he
sprinkles with a bunch of basil all members of the family,
as well as various rooms, and the image of the fêted saint.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the household regard the week prior to the fête as a
fast. The eve of the day of the <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>Slava</i></span> the lamp is lit before
the image of the saint, and is burnt for two days. A couple of
days before the anniversary a tasty dish is prepared, called
the <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>Koljivo</i></span>, mainly composed of wheat, nuts, and almonds.
Those families, however, who fête the Archangel Michael do not
prepare this cake, for the people believe that the Archangel
still lives, and cakes are only offerings to the dead.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>On the morning of the fête the head of the family lights a
taper, and the priest, after a ceremony, cuts a kind of bread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>specially prepared and bearing a cross; after which he
sprinkles wine upon it and upon the <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>Koljivo</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Everybody, from early morning, salutes the head of the
family with the words, “Sretna slava” (a happy fête), and
grasps his hand. If the visitor is a man, he embraces the
husband; if a woman, the wife. The daughter of the house
offers the <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>Koljivo</i></span> to the guests, and everyone takes a
spoonful of <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>slatko</i></span>—a kind of fruit preserve—brandy and
coffee. At noon, wine is also drunk. To the houses of the
better class telegrams and letters arrive all day. In the
country districts the day is given up to eating, drinking,
singing, and toasts.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fêted saint is considered to be the protector of the
family, to whom daily prayers are said and mediation asked
with the Almighty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next to the <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>Slava</i></span>, the fête most widely celebrated is
Christmas. There is a Servian couplet that runs—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>As there’s no day without light,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>So there’s no rejoicing without the Servian Christmas.</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>After a long fast, the Servian people await Christmas
impatiently. It is a day of feasting in the whole country.
Two days before Christmas Day—old style, of course—roasts
are prepared, consisting of a lamb and a sucking-pig. On
the morning of Christmas Eve one of the boys of the family
goes into the forest and cuts the Christmas log or <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>Badgnak</i></span>—a
usage which was recognised in the old days in France.
Choosing a young tree, he recites a prayer and cuts it down,
while another lad is careful that the first branch cut does not
fall to the ground. He clutches hold of it, and it is placed
in the milk, so that good cream shall be produced, or upon the
beehive, that the bees may bring good honey. The bringing
home of the Christmas log is attended by many quaint ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c001'>That evening, while the family is at supper—which mostly
consists of fruits—the head of the house takes three nuts in
his right hand, and throwing them towards the east exclaims,
“In the name of the Father”; then three others, which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>throws to the west saying, “and of the Son”; and then three
others he throws to the north, adding, “and of the Holy Ghost.”
Then with three others he makes the sign of the cross, and
throwing them to the south, exclaims “Amen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>With the dawn of Christmas Day visits commence, the
first person generally to arrive being a young man neighbour,
known as the <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>polaznik</i></span>. He embraces the master of the
house, makes the sign of the cross upon the Yule-log, and wishes
good luck to the household. In the Christmas cake is placed
a piece of money, and the person to whom it falls will have good
fortune all the year.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Easter feast comes third with the Servians, and is a
great occasion for egg-breaking, one egg being broken against
the other. Each visitor receives an egg, and the fête lasts
three days. The gipsies, of whom there are very many in the
Balkans, go from house to house at Easter, singing and wishing
good fortune to the householders, receiving, of course, money
in return for their good wishes.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is also an extraordinary institution among the
Servians called the <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>pobratime</i></span>. It often occurs that two
persons of the same sex love one another very dearly, and
regret that they are not allied by relationship. In such a
case they go through a solemn ceremony, and become <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>pobratimes</i></span>,
or brothers by election. It is the same with both
sexes. In many cases religion or nationality does not count,
for there are numbers of cases where a Serb has chosen for
<span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>pobratime</i></span> a Turk or an Albanian. In some cases the ceremony
is a grave and solemn one before a priest. Sometimes, indeed,
the two persons make a slight cut in each other’s hands, and
suck each other’s blood, so becoming blood relations. This
custom is, strangely enough, very prevalent among the more
savage of the African tribes. The <span lang="sr" xml:lang="sr"><i>pobratimes</i></span> remain faithful
and devoted one to the other until death.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Belgrade resembles no other European capital for several
reasons. There are no poor quarters of squalor and misery,
and pauperism is unknown. During the whole time I was in
the capital not a single person solicited alms. During the
last thirty years land in the vicinity of the city has quadrupled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>in value. Each house is generally occupied by one family, and
almost every house has a pretty garden or courtyard. For
many years there has been constant rebuilding, and nowadays
houses are usually built of brick in preference to stone—although
there is a Brick Trust in the country. A good granite is also
employed, and the new buildings are mostly ornate and
handsome.</p>

<p class='c001'>Modern Belgrade is well planned. The Rue Terasia and
the Rue Prince Michel run on the highest part of the plateau
and form the main artery of traffic, while from these two
streets diverge other thoroughfares, on the one side leading to
the Danube, and on the other to the Save.</p>

<p class='c001'>Viewed from the Danube, the panorama of Belgrade is a
fine and imposing one. A commodious quay is badly required
for the ever-increasing river traffic, but plans have
already been prepared, and shortly the work will be put in
hand. High above the river runs the pleasant promenade in
the Kalemegdan Gardens, leading to the old fortress with
its time-mellowed red brick bastions, now turned into a prison.
The position of the city is certainly well adapted to expand
into a really fine, handsome capital, as it must become
in the near future. It is the centre of intellectual life of
Servia. The Library and Museum testify to the literary
tastes of the Servians. The Museum is very rich in antiques,
and contains a highly interesting numismatic collection.
Both science and art are well cultivated in the Servian capital,
which is also the headquarters of the Metropolitan Archbishop,
the courts of Cassation and of Appeal, the État Major, the
Military School, the Faculties, and the Ecclesiastical School.</p>

<p class='c001'>The capital of Servia therefore occupies a most favourable
position, and is designed to become a very important centre of
commerce. Its situation being at the junction of the Save and
the Danube, at the head of the railway which unites the
European capitals with the Black Sea ports, as well as with
Salonica and Constantinople, it cannot fail to be the gate of
the whole commerce of the Orient. It is, indeed, the Gateway
of the East.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nisch, in the south, is the town second in importance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>In 1874 it contained only 12,000 population, while to-day it
has more than 30,000 inhabitants. Standing as it does at the
junction of the Oriental with the European railways, all the
merchandise to or from Turkey passes through it: either by
way of Sofia, or by Usküb and Macedonia. The old Turkish
quarter has been recently destroyed, wide streets built, and
the town thoroughly modernised and brought up to date,
while there are several comfortable hotels. The country
around Nisch is noted for its excellent light wines, which,
having tasted, I can recommend. In Nisch, as in many other
parts of Servia, there are many openings for the profitable
employment of British capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Servian Government is anxious to promote commerce
and industry throughout the kingdom. It is ready to give
facility and encouragement to foreigners—and especially the
English—to exploit the wealth that undoubtedly abounds,
and it will treat them honestly, justly, and well.</p>

<p class='c001'>Country life presents many interesting features. The
Servian is much more industrious than the Roumanian or the
Bulgar, and consequently is much more the master of his own
household. The house of the Servian peasant is generally
constructed of brick, situate in the valleys and ravines, and is
usually of one storey only. There are generally three or four
rooms, the larger one being used as a common sitting and
dining room. The furniture of the common room is very
simple—a table, chairs, and settle and wardrobe; while upon the
whitewashed walls are coloured religious prints. The other
rooms are covered with bright-coloured Servian carpets, and in
some villages of the Machva and the valley of the Morava—where
the peasants appear to live in greater comfort—I found
Viennese bent-wood furniture. In the poorer districts the
house often consists of one room only, and is often constructed
by the peasant himself. Each house has its little garden,
cultivated by the women or the old folk, where vegetables are
grown, more especially cabbages, of which there is a great
consumption in various forms, often preserved as a kind of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>choucroute</i></span>. Fresh-water fish is also a staple article of diet,
while caviare too is plentiful.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>In my journey through Servia I was struck by the prosperity
of the peasant and his high intelligence everywhere. The
country, especially in the more mountainous districts, is most
picturesque, and the quaint costumes of both sexes are highly
interesting. Time was when there were many brigands in
the more remote districts. An officer of my acquaintance
who has explored practically every corner of Servia told me an
amusing episode that quite lately occurred to him. He was
riding one day in the mountains in a far remote part of Servia,
many miles from a town, when he overtook a rather evil-looking
man, who scowled at him. He passed the time of day
and inquired the road to his destination. Then he added,
“I’ve heard there are brigands round about here. Is it true?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Brigands!” exclaimed the man. “Well, we used to be
brigands. But nowadays the law is so strict that I and
my comrades have given it up!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The costume of the Servian peasant-women is quaint and
of interest. It consists of an ample skirt of wool or silk and a
corset on which, over the chest, is placed a piece of white gauze
crossed. Over this is a kind of bolero of tanned skin with the
fur inside, cut lower than the waist at the back, and open in
front. Upon it are often gold or silver embroideries. Upon
the head is worn a small scarlet fez, around which the plaited
hair is coiled. The fez is often embroidered with seed pearls,
which descend from generation to generation and are often
worth twenty to thirty pounds. Then, lastly, there is the
apron, which is part of the national costume, and is of wool,
hand-embroidered in gay colours, many of them being of quaint
and original design.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the towns both men and women now adopt European
costume. In the country every peasant possesses a gun, and
shooting as they do from childhood, they are mostly very fine
shots. They love the chase, and shoot everything they can,
for the country is full of all kinds of birds and animals.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a good deal of superstition among the peasants,
who are an imaginative people, who believe in vampires, evil
spirits, and witches, and have many extraordinary legends and
sayings concerning them.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> AN AUDIENCE OF KING PETER</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>At the New Konak—I sign His Majesty’s birthday-book—The audience-chamber—King
Peter greets me, and we chat over cigarettes—My
private audience—His Majesty and English capitalists—Great openings
for British enterprise—The King gives me some instances of paying
concerns, and tells me many interesting facts—His Majesty invites me
to return.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I drove into the wide gates of the New Konak one
evening in November to have private audience of His
Majesty King Peter of Servia, sentries saluted, idling detectives
bowed, and the lines of blue-and-gold servants drawn up in the
entrance all bent low with one accord. The royal palace is,
indeed, well guarded.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the large inner hall was a wide horseshoe staircase,
which I ascended. On every hand was a regal splendour,
all in excellent taste and all very new, for the palace built by
King Milan has been renovated since 1903, when the former
royal residence of such tragic memory was pulled down. Its
site is now a pretty lawn.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the head of the stairs the Royal Marechal, Colonel
Tcholak-Antich, a young man in bright blue uniform and
many decorations, met me. With the usual etiquette he told
me his name, I told him mine, and we shook hands. Then
he said, “His Majesty is anxious that you should sign his
birthday book,” and he led me to the big council-chamber,
where at the head of the table he opened a beautiful book,
which I signed upon the proper page.</p>

<div id='i130'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_130fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Royal Palace, Belgrade: The Ballroom.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I was at once conducted to the audience-chamber, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>double doors of which—to prevent eavesdroppers—were
closed behind me, and I was left alone to await His Majesty.
The room, of fine dimensions, seemed, under the myriad electric
lamps, ablaze with gold. The beautiful gilt furniture showed
well against the carpet of crushed-strawberry, the damask of
the upholstery matching the carpet and being brocaded with
gold. Several fine modern paintings were upon the walls,
and in the centre of the magnificent apartment a large settee
and several fine gilt chairs set against a big gilt Renaissance
table.</p>

<p class='c001'>Scarce had I time to glance at my surroundings when
the long white folding-doors at the end of the room opened,
and there entered a slim, alert figure in a dark blue military
uniform—a keen, dark-eyed, grey-moustached man with a
pleasant smile and hand outstretched—His Majesty.</p>

<p class='c001'>I made my obeisance, and took the proffered hand.
“Come,” said the King kindly in French, seating himself at
the table, and motioning me to a chair opposite him. “Well,”
he commenced, “you know I have lived in London, and I
have heard of you, Monsieur N——,” and he went on to say
some highly gratifying words concerning myself; then
producing a big silver box of most excellent Servian cigarettes,
gave me one, held the match for me, and also smoked himself.
He was, I noticed, quick, smart, and shrewd, with both figure
and bearing that greatly reminded me of Lord Roberts, his
general’s dark undress uniform being relieved by one touch of
colour, the crimson-and-white ribbon and white enamelled
star of Karageorge.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, when we were comfortably settled, I explained to
him my reasons for visiting the Balkans.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are very welcome here in Servia,” His Majesty
said. “You have been kind enough to say generous things
about our country. All we ask of you is not to flatter us—only
inquire the truth for yourself. We Servians have our faults—all
nations have. But it must be remembered that we are a
young nation—like France was after the war of 1870. The Press
of Europe have not been altogether fair to us, for very many
false statements have been published regarding our people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>and myself personally. But how could they be contradicted?
We only wish the organs of the British Press would tell the truth
regarding Servia. We have enemies—who has not? But our
policy is one of peace, and our earnest endeavour is to develop
the great resources of our country. Servia is, as you know,
one of the richest mineral countries in Europe.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I presume your Majesty’s Government will grant concessions
for the working of mines, or for other industrial
enterprises?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Most readily. But only to responsible persons, who can
show their earnestness and that capital is at their command.
Of late we have had many concession-hunters here from
various parts of Europe, but the majority have gone empty
away because they were discovered to be mere speculators.
No. Our urgent desire is that your British capitalists should
come here and study matters for themselves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I believe some mines are already being worked by foreign
capital?” I remarked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly—and very wealthy they are too. Take the
Bor copper mine, for instance. I visited it myself this year.
The 500-franc shares are now at 3000 francs, and the output
will shortly be enormous. They have recently discovered
in the workings traces that the ancient Romans had been
there. It will, so experts say, be found to be one of the richest
copper mines in Europe. Besides copper we have iron, coal,
antimony, and even gold—all of which might, with great
advantage, be exploited by English companies. We invite
the English in preference, because I know that English commercial
undertakings are, for the most part, solid and sound.
You English always think well before you commence, and
when you do commence you go straight on to success. Therefore
any industrial enterprise, or any railways—which we
want badly—that you may suggest to us on behalf of British
capitalists shall have our most earnest consideration. That
the country is in a settled state and is prospering is, I think,
shown by our finances. Before 1903 there was constantly a
deficit on the Budget. In 1903 we had over one million francs
in excess of the estimates, in 1904 we had five millions, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>1905 a little over four millions. Our engagements are regularly
paid, and we have no floating debt.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>“And the future?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! you want me to talk politics,” he laughed, raising
his hand with the fine diamond upon it. “No. I make a
rule never to do so. One of our chief faults in Servia is that
we gossip too much upon politics. You have noticed that, I
daresay, in the cafés, in the Legations, and elsewhere—eh?
All we Servians are the same—in Montenegro, in Bosnia, and
elsewhere. It is always so with a young nation. The future
of Servia will, I fervently hope, be one of peace and prosperity.
It shall be my most earnest endeavour to secure this for my
people, so that Servia may prove to Europe that she does not
now merit the hard things said of her in the past.”</p>

<p class='c001'>His Majesty, after we had chatted about Florence, a city
which I found he knew quite well, then told me a very interesting
fact. “We have here, in Servia,” he said, “a most
wonderful cure for rheumatism—the Ribarska Banya. I
only tell you what happened personally to me. During the
Russo-Turkish War I contracted acute rheumatism, and have
been a martyr to it ever since. I visited every watering-place
in Europe, but none of the so-called “cures” did me
any good. Two years ago, with some reluctance, I went to
Ribarska and took the cure, and from that moment I have
never since been troubled. It was miraculous! With my own
eyes I saw a poor woman wheeled there entirely crippled, and
twenty days later I saw her commencing to walk. I would
not have believed it had I not seen it with my own eyes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>For an hour and a half we chatted upon many things—of
London, of Paris, of Rome, of Vienna—for His Majesty is
essentially an up-to-date man of the world, as well as a monarch.
Sincere and yet humorous, kindly and yet with a hauteur that
well befits his military bearing, he struck me as a man well
adapted to rule the Servian nation—a man who is thoroughly
in earnest, and is doing his level best for the future of his
nation. “We want no external troubles,” he declared to
me. “We want to be allowed to progress.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And when I took my leave His Majesty grasped my hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>warmly, saying, “I hope, M’sieur N——, you will return to
Servia often, and remember that whenever you are in Belgrade
I shall always be happy to give you audience and have another
chat with you. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Bon soir.</i></span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>I bowed. The long white doors opened noiselessly by an
unseen hand, and His Majesty was gone.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next day an aide-de-camp brought me the autographed
portrait which appears in these pages, together with a very
kindly message from His Majesty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not only did I endeavour to learn the truth at the royal
palace, but I went among the people in various towns in
Servia, making inquiries, and I found on every hand that
Servia was pleased and satisfied with her new ruler.</p>

<p class='c001'>King Peter was born on July 11, 1844, at Belgrade. A son of
the reigning Prince Alexander Karageorgevitch. Educated
at Belgrade and Geneva, he went to St. Cyr in France, and
afterwards, during the war of 1870, volunteered in the French
army. In 1883 he married the Princess Zorka, eldest daughter
of Prince Nicholas of Montenegro, with whom he led a very
happy family life until her unfortunate death in 1890. For
about ten years he lived in Montenegro, but after his wife’s
death he went to Geneva for the education of his children.
In Montenegro there is still great admiration for him among
the people, who have always regarded him as one of the Serb
princes.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were four children, of whom three are still living,
namely, the Crown Prince George, now aged 20; Princess Helene,
aged 19; and Prince Alexander, aged 18. The Crown Prince
after his studies in Geneva was admitted by order of the Tzar
into the Noble Guard at St. Petersburg, and on the accession of
his father left Russia to complete his studies in Servia. At the
present time he is engaged in university studies, combined
with his military ones. I had an opportunity of meeting him,
and found him a very smart and intelligent young fellow.
Legally he is now of age, and lately he represented his father
at a great national festivity, and acquitted himself with
complete success. He is greatly interested in all military
questions, and is himself one of the best riders in the country.</p>

himself in sanitation, improvements in agriculture, the securing
of a better standard of morality, and in all questions of religion—in
fact, his chief aim is the advancement and well-being of
his people, which, he is confident, cannot be attained without a
strong religious belief.</p>

<p class='c001'>Only a short time ago he was making a tour in the country
when to him came the priests and authorities complaining
that the people did not go to church. His Majesty’s reply to
the priests was: “If the people do not come to you, you should
go to them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>From my own personal observation of His Majesty, I
found him to be exceedingly active, both physically and mentally.
Though sixty-two years of age, he may be seen every
morning at five o’clock out riding in the environs of Belgrade,
making inspections of military camps and often gossiping
with and giving counsel to the lowliest peasants. Many are
the amusing stories told of these encounters, for often the
peasants are unaware that it is their sovereign. On one
occasion, quite lately, he was speaking with a peasant who
complained to him of misbehaviour of a subordinate functionary,
and said, “The King ought to know it!” whereupon His
Majesty replied, “Yes, I think so. I will certainly tell him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>His Majesty told me himself that he does not believe in
the old idea that “the King can do no wrong,” or that monarchs
are only “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par la grâce de Dieu</i></span>.” He is of opinion that they
should do everything to fulfil the second part of the formula,
“by the will of the people,” and do their utmost for the
people over whom they rule.</p>

<p class='c001'>Without prejudice, and without bias, I have no hesitation
in saying that Servia to-day is under a most beneficent régime,
and it is hoped that her ruler, a splendid type of man and an
up-to-date monarch, may be spared many years to realise the
high aspirations which he has for the country that gave him
birth.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER III <br /> SERVIA’S AIMS AND ASPIRATIONS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Audiences of M. Pachitch, the Premier and “strong man” of Servia, and of
M. Stoyanovitch, Minister of Commerce—My friend, Dr. Milenko Vesnitch,
Minister of Justice—The Servian case as I found it—Austria
Servia’s arch-enemy—Dr. Vesnitch an up-to-date politician—Undeniable
prosperity of the country under King Peter’s rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>He who attempts to study Servian politics will find himself
engulfed in a perfect vortex of mystery and intrigue.</p>

<p class='c001'>Politics occupy everyone’s thought in Belgrade. The
Pachitch Party is on everyone’s tongue. Be it at the luncheon
table of the restaurant, over the card-table at the Grand Café
at six o’clock, in the salons of the Ministers’ wives, or at the
smart diplomatic receptions, the gossip is always of politics.
Hence it is that the secret agent is everywhere, and one hears
complaints on every hand of telegrams being noted and letters
tampered with.</p>

<p class='c001'>Having regard to recent events and the presence of a horde
of Austrian spies, this is not, perhaps, surprising. Though
Servia is undoubtedly prospering and contented under King
Peter and the present Ministry, yet there is, of course, in
politics an opposition—though not a formidable one.</p>

<p class='c001'>During my stay in Belgrade, besides being graciously
granted private audience by His Majesty King Peter, I had
many opportunities of discussing Servian politics with the
Premier, M. Nicholas Pachitch; Dr. Milenko Vesnitch, Minister
of Justice; M. Stoyanovitch, the Minister of Commerce; M.
Patchu, Minister of Finance; M. Andrea Nikolitch, Minister
of Public Instruction; M. Yovan Gyaya, who has formed the
new Radical Party; and many other leading men of both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>sides. I very carefully investigated each question, in order to
present to the British public, for the first time, the actual
truth of the present state of affairs in Servia.</p>

<p class='c001'>Quite recently the British Government resumed diplomatic
relations with the Servian Court, therefore it is fitting that
a fair and unbiassed statement should now be put forward,
in order to show Servia as she really is, her aims, her aspirations,
and her future policy in the Balkans.</p>

<p class='c001'>I confess that I found considerable difficulty in forming
my conclusions. The policy, however, which the present
strong and level-headed Government are pursuing is a policy
which, having carefully heard both sides, I have no hesitation
whatever in endorsing as the very best for the peace and future
of the nation. It is strong, without being belligerent, even
though Austria has never ceased to annoy, irritate, and
intrigue.</p>

<p class='c001'>Balkan questions are both difficult and intricate, but I
will endeavour to describe the true state of affairs as plainly
and briefly as possible. This work, though not intended to be
a political treatise, would be incomplete without some explanation
of the mysteries of the politics of the various Balkan
countries I visited. Therefore, at risk of being perhaps a little
too outspoken, I will state the Servian case just as I found it.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the burning questions in Servia at the present time
is the Customs War with Austria. The latter Power has
endeavoured to ruin Servia, but has fortunately not succeeded,
even though her emissaries are everywhere, and many newspaper
correspondents are undoubtedly in her pay. For this
latter reason Servia has, for many years past, been presented
to Europe in a false light and columns of untruths telegraphed
from Zimony, or Semlin, the Hungarian town on the opposite
bank of the Save.</p>

<p class='c001'>Briefly, the truth is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c001'>Austria—and with her Germany—is slowly but surely
marching to the East. One sees and hears evidence of it
everywhere in the Balkans. The extended talons of the
Austrian eagle are as apparent—and perhaps more so in
Servia than in Montenegro. Servia bars Austria’s way southward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>to that much-coveted port, Salonica. It is therefore not
to Austria’s interest that Servia should be at peace. Unfortunately
for Servia, the Occidental people view the Eastern
questions through the spectacles of the Vienna Press, which
is—for the most part—inspired by the Austrian Government.</p>

<p class='c001'>Austria is at the bottom of the whole of the Servian difficulties.
As long as things went badly in Servia—as under the
régime of the late King Alexander—they allowed matters to go
on without interference, and watched eagerly for the downfall
of the kingdom. Unfortunate events occurred, as is well
known, but to the great dismay of Servia’s arch-enemy, the
country has become contented and is greatly prospering under
the rule of King Peter. For this reason, therefore, because a
prosperous era has set in, Austria has once again sought to
stir discord and to create troubles and difficulties. At the
moment of writing the secret police have a long list of over
one hundred Austrian political agents living in Belgrade alone!</p>

<p class='c001'>How Austria seeks to compromise Servia in the eyes of
Europe, and the scandalous methods by which she is seeking
to attain that end, is well illustrated by a telegram which was
supposed to emanate from Odessa, but which I have indisputable
evidence came from the same source as all the others—an
unscrupulous correspondent in Vienna in the secret pay
of the Austrian Government.</p>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The amazing telegram in question appeared in the London
newspapers on January 2 this year, and was as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“The local agency of the Russian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, which for the last twenty years has been specially
retained in Odessa as a convenient medium of secret
intelligence respecting the Balkan States, is in possession
of indisputable proofs of the existence, notwithstanding
all recent and official denials from Belgrade, of a widely
ramified and elaborately matured plot for the execution
of a sudden <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>coup d’état</i></span> and the expulsion of the Karageorgevitch
dynasty from Servia. Leading members,
civil and military, of both the chief political parties
are stated to have joined the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“According to this information, the intended first
result of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>coup d’état</i></span>, if it be not marred, will be the
establishment of a provisional regency in the administrative
hands of six or eight Ministers. The regents would
then take time to prepare a comprehensive explanatory
statement of the situation for presentation to the
Great Powers, which they would also consult as to
the choice of an alien prince for the royal throne of
Servia. They will urge upon the friendly consideration
of the Powers the fact that the two peasant dynasties
of Obrenovitch and Karageorgevitch have been fairly
tried and justly found impossible and incompatible
with the economical welfare and progressive culture
necessary to the worthy attainment of Servia’s proper
political destiny.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>In reply to this, the Servian Government nailed the lies
upon Austria by the following official statement, issued on
January 3 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Belgrade:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“All sorts of misleading fabrications have lately been
issued to the world by the Austrian Press for the purpose
of compromising the political situation in Servia, the
latest report being that of an alleged plot to exile the
Karageorgevitch dynasty. Gradually and systematically
the Viennese newspapers have been communicating
to the foreign Press alarming news, injurious to Servia’s
good name, and certain quarters in Vienna consider
it necessary to reserve the fabrication regarding the
exile of the Karageorgevitch dynasty as the final stroke
on the eve of the conclusion of the Servian loan. The
Austrian Press has even gone so far as to make use of
prevarications in order to succeed in giving credence
to its report regarding the exile of the royal dynasty,
alleging they had obtained news from the Russian
Agency created at Odessa by the Russian Minister of
Foreign Affairs for special political service in the Balkans.
According to our information, <em>such an agency does not
even exist</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Again, an ingenious gentleman representing the Vienna
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Zeit</i></span>, who lives opposite Belgrade, at Semlin, in Hungary, and
fears to cross into Servia, sent the other day, not only to the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Zeit</i></span> but to the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>, an extraordinary telegram declaring
the Servian Crown Prince to be slightly demented, and casting
all sorts of insinuations as to what was happening in the
palace.</p>

<p class='c001'>I chanced to be in Belgrade at the time, and showed the
Crown Prince the ridiculous concoction, and we both laughed
over it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bah!” he said, “it is really too silly to require contradiction.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The true fact is that the young Crown Prince, who gave me
the signed portrait that appears in these pages, is a particularly
smart young man, and not only do his tutors, but also the
Cabinet Ministers of Servia, speak in the highest terms of his
tact and intelligence.</p>

<p class='c001'>But to Austria no method is too mean or too unscrupulous
by which to circulate false news to the detriment of Servia.
Ask any Servian, and he will tell you of Austria’s machinations
in every quarter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Quite recently a Servian author wrote some libellous and
untrue articles regarding the present dynasty, and was consequently
arrested and condemned to imprisonment. Whereupon
the Austrian Minister in Belgrade, without asking
permission of the Minister of Justice, went to the prison and
prevailed upon the Governor to be allowed to see the prisoner
privately. Such action surely speaks louder than words!</p>

<p class='c001'>The Austrian attitude was well exhibited on the occasion
of the accession of King Peter. His Majesty received two
telegrams. The first was from the Tzar, who said, “I hope
you may be able to bring happiness to the Servian people,
and by doing so you will receive my friendship.” The other
was from the Emperor Francis Josef, and was certainly in the
spirit of dividing King and people, for His Majesty merely
expressed a hope that the evils existing would be remedied.</p>

<p class='c001'>Austria’s chief aim in Servia is to estrange the people from
their King, to create as much discord and discontent as possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>to crush the trade of the country and to keep her poor. As
long as she believed that Servia was in a bad position
economically and financially, things were allowed to go from
bad to worse. But as soon as an improvement was observed
in the national prosperity, a hostile policy was adopted, which
has rendered trade between the two countries impossible.</p>

<p class='c001'>Careful inquiries of the Servian Cabinet Ministers and
many statesmen of both political parties show that even in
the present position, with Austria closed against her, Servia
is nevertheless progressing, and prospering more than the
outside world ever dreams.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last commercial treaty between Austria and Servia
expired in 1904. There was a desire on the part of Servia to
at once renew it, but this Austria-Hungary was unable to do,
as she was rearranging her treaty with Germany. When,
however, the first negotiations were started, Austria made
very severe complaints regarding the Serbo-Bulgarian Customs
Union, and asked that the treaty in question should be
annulled before negotiations for the new treaty were started.
The Servian Government, desirous of pleasing Austria, replied
that in the Serbo-Bulgarian Customs Union there was a
clause to the effect that if one of the Great Powers raised a
protest, amendments might be introduced. They therefore
suggested the postponement of this question, hoping that
Austria was satisfied, and would begin the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pourparlers</i></span>. But
no such thing. Austria had other aims, for very soon they
coolly declared that if the commercial treaty were renewed,
Servia must buy her new armament for the artillery of the
Scoda works in Austria. This is peculiar, inasmuch as the
cannon in question is not that in use by the Austrian artillery!</p>

<p class='c001'>The reason for this has been explained by the fact that
certain members of the Austrian Imperial family were financially
interested in the works in question. This, however, was
not the real reason. There was one far more subtle. The
true political reason, indeed, was that the Austrian Government
wished to get a seat in the “Autonom-Monopol”
administration—the body which controls the loans, and which
consists of six members, namely, one French delegate, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>German, and four Servians. France and Germany were both
friendly, but Austria, had she gained a seat there, could at
once have created internal dissension and difficulty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nominally, the annual income from this “Monopol” is
about thirty million dinars, or francs, of which twenty million
go to the creditors, leaving ten million at the free disposal of
the Government. Now had Austria obtained a hand in this
administration, she would have been able to exercise a prerogative
and a right of intervention in many matters affecting
the good government of the country—a danger that will at
once be apparent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Austrian intrigue is everywhere apparent, not only in
Belgrade, but throughout the whole of Servia. Austria does
not wish either a national or a staple Government in Servia,
and so, because they could not obtain their ends, and because
the present Government voices the national ideas of the whole
of the Serb people—who are as a matter of fact spread over
Croatia, Slavonia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, and
part of Hungary—they have pursued the Customs War, and
put a prohibitive tariff upon everything in the endeavour
to close entirely the world’s markets to Servia. The latter
has of course retaliated by placing a prohibitive tariff upon
all goods from those nations who have no treaty—a move
which is of course directed against Austria, but by which other
Powers must, for the present, suffer.</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards England, the first commercial treaty made by
Servia after the Berlin Treaty was with Great Britain, and
it served as the base of all the other treaties. Of this Austria-Hungary
was jealous, and from that time until to-day Austria
has done everything in her power to discredit and discourage
British trade in the Balkans. In fact, so seriously detrimental
has been Austria’s influence against British trade that naturally
some time must elapse ere the damage done can be repaired.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, a new commercial treaty with England has
been arranged, for it was in Servia’s greatest interest that
this should be done. Every Servian I spoke to was loud in his
praises of England, and of English methods. Servia is very
anxious to export her agricultural produce to England, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>in Servia—now that Austrian imports have stopped—there
are many open markets for English goods.</p>

<p class='c001'>Austria believed that as all Servian exports were sent into
Austria-Hungary, Servia would be obliged in the end to
accept their drastic and unfair terms—the purchase of cannon
and other restrictions. On the contrary, however, it says
much for Servia’s enterprise that, though the Austrian frontier
has been closed during 1906, yet Servia has exported all her
goods by way of Varna or Braila, or by Salonica, to which
port a line of rail runs from Nisch. The producer has felt
the Austrian oppression but little, if any at all. In fact, it is
the opinion of many statesmen in Servia that it would actually
be in the country’s interests if Austria continues her present
hostile Customs policy, for it will then compel the Servians to
look for markets farther afield, and arouse them to take
strong initiatives.</p>

<p class='c001'>It should be noted, too, that fifteen years ago Austria
raised the same trouble with Roumania, and the Roumanians
are now happily emancipated from the Austrian market, and
are consequently prosperous.</p>

<p class='c001'>At present, with the Austrian frontier barred for export,
Servia must build a railway to the Adriatic. The line from
Nisch, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>viâ</i></span> Usküb, to Salonica, though it runs through Macedonia,
is practically under Austrian control, and goods sent over
it from Servia are subjected to high tariff. Therefore there
is a project afoot to construct a new line from Kragooyevatz
across the Kopaonik Mountains to Prisrend, and thence
through Northern Albania down to Skodra and the Adriatic
at the port of San Giovanni di Medua. An alternative scheme
is to construct the line so that it passes through Montenegro,
and joins the line at present being made by an Italian company
from Antivari on the coast to Virpasar on the Lake of Scutari.</p>

<p class='c001'>One or other of these two schemes will certainly be adopted
in the near future, and when the line is completed, Servia will
at once be entirely independent of Austria, and secure an
outlet to the Adriatic. Such a railway will be of great strategic
importance, as will be seen from a glance on the map. I have
been over parts of the projected route, and certainly it will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>be a very difficult line to construct, on account of the wall of
mountains lying between the Lake of Scutari and the Servian
frontier. But its opening will mean civilising the wild tribes
of Albania and the further cementing of the Serb nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>This last point is, indeed, the chief line of the Servian
Balkan policy. In my conversations with the Premier, with Dr.
Milenko Vesnitch, Minister of Justice, and with the Ministers
of Commerce and of Finance, I found them all in accord upon
the one great principle of policy, namely, the preservation of
the great Serb nation, which consists of over ten million persons,
spread through Bosnia, Herzegovina, Slavonia, Kossovo,
Montenegro, Servia, Dalmatia, and many parts of Hungary
itself. This great population speak the same language and
have the same aspirations, namely, the unity of the great
nation whose past history is such a splendid one.</p>

<p class='c001'>The policy of the Servian Ministry, whether military,
economical, or political, is all directed towards this one end,
and here it may be pointed out that King Peter is grandson
of the great hero of the Servian people, the peasant Karageorge,
who in 1804 raised the Servians against the Turks and defeated
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>King Peter has already given evidence of his patriotic
sentiments, not only interesting himself in the nation before
he was elected ruler, but perhaps it is not generally remembered
that in 1875 he fought at the head of his troop—which he
raised himself, and crippled his finances thereby—for the
emancipation of Bosnia. In the Servian national poetry
there is a hero called Peter Mrcognitch, the Protector of the
Poor against the oppressors, and it was under this assumed
name that the present ruler of Servia fought. In 1870, too,
he fought with the French against the Germans, and was
awarded the Legion of Honour for valour on the battlefield.
Therefore the Servians regard him as a patriot—as indeed
he is—and up to the present he has certainly shown himself
an able, wise, and discreet ruler, who has the interests of his
country very deeply at heart.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>To refer to the tragic events of the night of June 11, 1903,
is unnecessary. All I can personally say is that I arrived in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Belgrade full of an Englishman’s natural prejudice against
the present régime, but after careful inquiry, not only in
government and diplomatic circles, but also among the
adherents of the old régime, I came to the conclusion that though
drastic and cruel, yet had not those events happened that
night, hundreds of unfortunate ones would have lost their
lives on the following morning.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the régime of the late King no one was safe in Belgrade.
Draga had her spies everywhere, and alas for those who
dared to utter a word against her or her methods! Leading
men in the political, social, and literary world of Belgrade
to-day have explained to me how they had from day to day
lived in fear and dread of false accusations and arrest, until
life became so intolerable that many were almost driven
from the country. These men strongly disagreed with the
methods of the regicides, but they are now thankful they
are free.</p>

<p class='c001'>The truth of those black days of spies and suspicion in
Belgrade in the last days of Alexander’s reign has never been
told. Only those who lived there, and only those who hear
the truth from the lips of responsible persons, can realise how
entirely the country was in the hands of one unscrupulous
woman. The journalists of Europe were horrified at the
methods by which the Obrenovitch were wiped out, and they
condemned the Servians. Not one had the courage, or the
inclination, to put the facts fairly and impartially before
the public.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER IV <br /> THE FUTURE OF SERVIA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Servia and the Macedonian question—A sound Cabinet—England and Servia—Appointment
of Mr. Beethom Whitehead as British Minister very
gratifying to the Servians—King Peter ever solicitous for the welfare
of the people—What the Prime Minister told me concerning the future—The
new railway to the Adriatic.</p>

<p class='c007'>I make no apology for the assassination of King Alexander
and his Queen. That matter is a closed page of
Servian history. I only can state what I saw and heard in
Servia, and explain how I drew my own entirely unbiassed
conclusions.</p>

<p class='c001'>One thing is certain, that Servia is at this moment in a
very much more prosperous condition than ever she was under
King Alexander. Having met every one of the Ministers, and
spent many hours with them, I can safely assert that, headed
by M. Pachitch, quiet-mannered, sensible, and thoughtful,
they are, one and all, a very strong and intelligent Cabinet,
each member of which is doing his very utmost for the commercial
development and future welfare of the country he
loves so dearly.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>poseur</i></span> or political adventurer among them.
Each man is a sound, intelligent, and trustful statesman,
whose watchword is, as His Excellency Monsieur Pachitch put
it to me, “Servia for the Servians.”</p>

<p class='c001'>While in Belgrade I had several conversations with members
of the Cabinet, and also with Dr. J. Cvijic, the eminent author
of that most thoughtful work, <cite>Remarks on the Ethnography of
the Macedonian Slavs</cite>, regarding the all-absorbing question of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Macedonia. Mention Macedonia to any Balkan statesman,
and he raises his shoulders and shakes his head. It is a
problem that nobody can solve. I endeavoured, however,
by dint of many inquiries, to discover in what way Servia
would like the Macedonian question settled.</p>

<p class='c001'>Roughly speaking, Macedonia is divided into three <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayets</i></span>—Kossovo,
Monastir, and Salonica. Now Kossovo is essentially
Old Servia, and there is no question that its people are still
Serbs. Yet here we run up against Austria again. She is
doing all in her power to cause the population to emigrate,
and in their place attracting Albanians who assist the Austrian
propaganda. As regards the other two <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayets</i></span> of Monastir
and Salonica, the inhabitants are Serbs, Bulgars, Greeks, and
Mohammedans. Now it is a curious fact, and one which
I believe no other writer has noted, that until two years ago
nobody spoke of any other people in Macedonia but these.
Suddenly, however, Europe was made aware that there was
still another people, for the Koutzo-Vlachs were, for the first
time, mentioned, and formed a new element in the already
mixed difficulty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now without doubt this new problem was introduced into
the controversy by Germany for two reasons. The first was to
create, besides the Mohammedan and Albanian, a Christian
Conservative element for the preservation of the Turk in
Europe. Germany has therefore an economic propaganda in
Turkey, and when the time is ripe it will be followed by a
strong political one. She could not count on either Serbs
or Bulgars in Macedonia, but by this new intrigue she has
courted the support of the Mohammedans.</p>

<p class='c001'>The second reason of the introduction of these hitherto
unheard-of Koutzo-Vlachs concerned the position in Roumania,
of which a Hohenzollern is King. Until two years ago the
Roumanian patriots were occupying themselves with a propaganda
in Transylvania. As, however, it is a great point in
German policy to keep Roumania within the confines of the
Triple Alliance, and as hostilities had arisen between Austria
and Roumania on account of the propaganda, it was necessary
for Germany to find a means to occupy in some other way the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>fantasy of the Roumanian people. And so the Koutzo-Vlachs
were pushed forward as a fresh discovery, and the
King of Roumania, in a speech to his Parliament, spoke of
“their brothers in Macedonia.” Beyond this, all the claims
put in by the Koutzo-Vlachs for the expenses of their schools
and other things to-day receive the support of the German
Ambassador at the Porte.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the Servian point of view—a view that is shared
very widely—it would appear that the best method of
solving the very difficult question of Macedonia would be
to give the various peoples complete tolerance—that is, to
give the Greeks, Serbs, Bulgarians, and Moslems complete
liberty to develop themselves for, say, ten years. After this
time a plebiscite, under the control of the Powers, might be
established with success. This would solve the ethnographical
difficulty, which is really the base of the whole question.</p>

<p class='c001'>The signatories to the Berlin Treaty would do well to
take the initiative in this matter, and so end the internal
trouble which is for ever a disturbing element in Balkan
politics. Servia is very anxious to see England interesting
and asserting her power more in the Balkans, and British
statesmen might well follow the policy of Palmerston and
Castlereagh. The first British representative to Servia was
Colonel Hodges, who in 1837 went to Belgrade, and very quickly
secured a predominant position in Servian matters, owing to
the unselfishness of the British policy in the Balkans and the
liberal ideas which England always represents in the world.
The Servians therefore still look to England as taking a leading
part in the settlement of Macedonia, and the sooner this is
done the less peril will exist in the Near East.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since the accession of King Peter many reforms have been
introduced, and on all sides the Servian people express content
and prosperity. I will give a few examples. For instance,
in the budget before the King’s accession there were periodical
deficits, but every year since, as I have already pointed out,
shows a very substantial balance. Therefore the present
increasing prosperity is apparent at a glance. The financial
market, too, shows how Servian finances stand in Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>This is no doubt due, in the first place, to the constitutional
cautiousness of King Peter. He has inspired with confidence
the financial world in Paris and elsewhere, for it is well known
that he is, before all, a constitutional ruler, and that his
Government will never be anything else than a constitutional
one. Therefore, by his attitude, he has so improved the state
of Servian finance that the future prosperity of the country is
assured.</p>

<p class='c001'>When King Peter was proclaimed, the Servians restored
their liberal Constitution, which the late King, under the
influence of his father, had abrogated. This has opened the
way to the development of the country in every direction.
There is, of course, much yet to be done. As regards the
administration of justice, several excellent reforms have been
introduced during the present reign. Dr. Vesnitch is at
present reforming the prison system, and is about to introduce,
after studying the question for fifteen years, a new
and unique system. He is of opinion that the prisoners from
the towns should be separated from those from the country,
for two reasons.</p>

<p class='c001'>He declares that when criminals from the towns commit
crimes it is in most cases because they are not sufficiently
instructed in their skilled labour. They are bad workmen,
and hence their downfall. If, however, they were classified
and instructed in the prison, they would, when discharged,
be better prepared, with the assistance of the Prisoners’ Aid
Societies, to seek an honest living. Again, the second reason
is that the influence of town-bred prisoners upon those from
the country is always an evil one, and should at all times be
avoided. The Servian Government have adopted the Minister’s
point of view, and fresh prisons are to be constructed upon that
basis.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another reform about to be introduced by Dr. Vesnitch is
that of “conditional release.” It is intended to preserve
first offenders from the demoralising influence of prison life,
and to create a good moral influence over those who commit a
crime for the first time. In a word, the Servian project seeks
to conciliate the English method with the French Loi Beranger.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>In all the other administrations—public instruction, war,
finance, and agriculture—many other reforms have been introduced,
and many are in course of preparation. As a matter
of fact, until two years ago Servia had no University, but at
present an excellent institution has been established, the professors
of which rank well with those of other nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the department of war, a very important reform is
about to be carried out, namely, the rearmament of the
artillery. This is, of course, a wide subject, and time must
elapse before the defences of the country are in an absolutely
perfect state. Suffice it, however, to say that the Ministers
of War and Finance are exerting every effort to obtain the
best weapons in France, and, at the same time, to leave the
country’s finances uncrippled.</p>

<p class='c001'>Recently diplomatic relations have been resumed with
England, and the Foreign Office have appointed Mr.
Beethom Whitehead as Minister to Servia. This has
given great satisfaction to the Servians, for they see in
this action of England that their Government has already
merited serious consideration. The resumption of friendship
with Great Britain has been the means of greatly
fortifying the Pachitch Ministry. It was obtained through
the good services of Italy and France, and especially of the
King of Italy, who, as is well known, is a great admirer
of England, in addition to being brother-in-law of King
Peter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Servia hopes that the result of this renewed friendship
will be to combat the German advances to the East; and
this, of course, is greatly to the advantage of England. The
Servians also hope that in the near future England will see
her way to minimise the evils which Lord Beaconsfield’s policy
created in the Balkans when he allowed Austria to occupy
Bosnia and Herzegovina and to monopolise Balkan trade
generally. It is probable that Lord Beaconsfield’s error was
due to his fear of a Pan-Slavonic danger, but the time is
certainly now ripe for England to assert her power and stem
the German tide.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is within the range of possibility that ere long Russia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>will unite with England, France, and Italy to take joint steps
in the Balkans, and if this is realised it will mean for Servia
that her autonomy and free development will be secured.
Diplomacy is working towards this end, and as the British
Liberal Party is believed to be the protector of weak
nations, it is more than likely the hope will very soon
mature.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have in this chapter spoken always of Austria, and not
of Hungary. I have done so because Hungary hopes for her
independence, and will, if she gains it, certainly find herself
on a level with Servia. The sympathy between the Servian
and Hungarian people is historical, and it was proved lately
by the transfer of the relics of the Hungarian hero, Racotzy,
who was the greatest opposer to Austrian rule. Quite recently
Wekerle, the Hungarian Premier, said in Parliament that
“the basis of Hungarian foreign policy has been, is, and has
to be, the continuance of Servia’s friendship.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Hungary has always found warm friends in England on
account of her struggle for independence, and without doubt
England will still support her when the day comes. Until ten
years ago it was generally thought in Hungary that the Slav
tendencies were dangerous to Hungary’s existence, but that
has now entirely changed, and instead of regarding Servia
as an enemy, they look upon her as an ally, and Germany
as an enemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The renewal of diplomatic relations between Servia and
England will, it is felt certain, be the means of inducing British
capitalists to make inquiry of the many and excellent openings
now existing. When once England is materially interested
in the Serb countries she will have a motive in
promoting Servia’s prosperity, and in protecting her from the
German advance, as a policy which surely will be to her own
advancement.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be here interesting, too, if in conclusion I give a
very brief summary of the trade of Servia during 1905—the
last published year—as compared with the four previous
years, as it will show the rapidly growing prosperity under
the present régime. In 1901 the exports were 65,685,653 fcs.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>and the imports 43,835,428 fcs.—a total of 109,521,081 fcs.;
in 1902 the total was 116,944,408 fcs.; in 1903, 118,202,666 fcs.</p>

<p class='c001'>For 1905 the figures were as follow:—</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus it will be seen that the country is undoubtedly
entering upon an era of prosperity.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the Department of Public Instruction I was afforded
facilities for studying the educational system, and a few facts
may prove interesting. Though Servia has been a free country
for less than a century, education has already reached a very
high level. It possesses a large number of primary schools,
secondary schools, and special schools, as well as a high school
in Belgrade which has lately been turned into a university.</p>

<p class='c001'>The name “popular schools” is given to infant schools,
primary schools, and the superior primary schools. The
course in the primary schools lasts for six years, and in the
primary superior schools two years. Children in towns are
sent into the first class of primary schools at the age of six, and
in the country at seven, the school year commencing on
September 1 and ending on June 29.</p>

<p class='c001'>Schoolmasters on leaving the training college receive
800 dinars (francs) per annum, and rise to 3000 dinars. Beyond
this they receive an allowance of 30 to 80 dinars a month in
lieu of lodging. For 1905 I was unfortunately unable to obtain
the statistics, but I found that in 1904 there were in Servia
1093 schools for boys and 170 schools for girls, or 1263 primary
schools. There were 1349 masters and 856 mistresses, or a
total of 2205 teachers. At the end of that scholastic year
there were 85,365 boys studying and 22,081 girls, a total
of 107,446 scholars. There were also five normal schools with
25 masters, and six schools for young girls with 25 mistresses.
There are also several excellent private schools. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Protestant and one Catholic are in Belgrade, while of the
three private schools for girls two are in Belgrade and one
in Nisch.</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards secondary schools, the course lasts eight years
and is terminable by examination. When the high school, or
university course, is ended, the students intending to become
masters receive a supernumerary place in a secondary school
with a salary of 1500 dinars. After about two years they
pass the examination of professors, whereupon they receive
2500 dinars, which is raised periodically to 6000 dinars. The
time-limit for professors is thirty years. In the secondary
schools are masters of languages and fine arts, and a very
high standard of instruction is given. The last return showed
there were 4561 scholars and 313 masters in these schools.
These figures, however, do not comprise the private gymnasiums
of Alexinac and Gradiste, or the superior schools for young
girls at Belgrade and Kragooyevac.</p>

<p class='c001'>The special schools comprise the religious seminary, the
academy of commerce, and the schools of agriculture. The
religious seminary is at Belgrade, and the course of instruction
lasts nine years. There are two schools of male teachers, one
at Alexinac and the other at Yagodina, and also two schools
for female teachers, at Belgrade and at Kragooyevac. Here,
the course is for four years. The Academy of Commerce is
in Belgrade, where a course of three years is given. There
is an excellent School of Agriculture at Kralyevo, as well as a
School of Forestry and Viticulture at Bukovo, where a three
years’ course is given.</p>

<p class='c001'>The University, which is at Belgrade, has only recently been
established, for hitherto it was only a high school. The instruction
is of the very highest order, and without doubt it will
turn out many intellectual men in the near future.</p>

<p class='c001'>One afternoon I went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
have audience of M. Nicholas Pachitch, the President of the
Council of Ministers and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Foreign Office is a great comfortable old building
adjoining the gardens of the royal palace, painted dead white,
and commanding from its windows a beautiful view over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the Save and the rolling plains beyond. The ante-chamber
is a sombre, old-fashioned room, with heavy furniture, several
fine pictures, and polished floor. But I was not given long
to inspect it, for a few minutes later I was ushered into the
private room of the man whom all Servia regards as the greatest
and cleverest politician—the man who is to make the New
Servia.</p>

<p class='c001'>I found him a quiet-mannered man, with kindly smiling
eyes behind his spectacles, his long beard and hair just silvered
with grey, his voice low, soft, and deliberate.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the midst of a turbulent day—for the Skupshtina was
sitting and important questions were being discussed—he
received me calmly, and though two Cabinet Ministers were
waiting outside for audience, he was cool and deliberate.
His manner was charmingly polite, and after greeting me, gave
me a seat at the table beside him, and readily answered the
questions I put to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have come here to learn about our country,” he said,
smiling. “Well, what can I tell you? You have, I daresay,
heard a good deal in England—some truth, and some
facts that are untrue—facts manufactured by the enemies
of Servia! We want peace. Our tariff difficulties with
Austria are regrettable, but we cannot accept the Austrian
terms. We cannot guarantee to buy our war material and
railway rolling-stock from Austria. Because we are a small
country the Austrian Empire is imposing upon us terms which
it is utterly impossible for us to accept. We must arm our
artillery with the best armament, be it Austrian, French,
German, or English. It is surely the duty of the Government
to do this. Why should we be bound to Austria in this
matter? As regards England, Servia is delighted at the
resumption of diplomatic relations, and at the appointment
of Mr. Whitehead, who is a clever diplomatist, a cosmopolitan,
and who already understands us. It is now our
intention to show Europe that we are a sound nation, and by
so doing we hope that English capitalists will seek to exploit
our vast mineral wealth. In Servia there are mines in all parts—coal,
iron, copper, lead, antimony, zinc, and even gold. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>only require working, and great profits must accrue. I daresay
you have seen the geological map which the Ministry of
Commerce has recently prepared. If not, I am sure Mr.
Stoyanovitch, the Minister, will allow you to see it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the present condition of the country?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Under the present rule the people have shown themselves
absolutely contented. There is an entire personal liberty which
did not exist under the late King. Our watchword is ‘Servia
for the Servians.’ Our policy is to avoid all outside complications,
and endeavour to do our utmost to develop the
resources of the country.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And Macedonia?”</p>

<p class='c001'>His Excellency smiled and shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! Macedonia!” he sighed. “Now you have touched
upon a difficult question. The population there is mixed, it
is true, and the problem puzzles every statesman in Europe;
yet my own personal opinion is that in the course of a year or
two the Powers will discover a mode of settlement which
will be found to be beneficial to all concerned.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the future policy of Servia?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You can tell them in England that all Servia desires is
‘peace,’” His Excellency answered, smiling at me through
his spectacles. “This we are doing all we possibly can to
promote. His Majesty has great admiration for the English,
and the Government are ready to grant concessions for industrial
and mining enterprises to English capitalists—if
properly introduced. I can assure you that they will find in
Servia excellent returns for their investments. But inquire
for yourself, and you will find that Servia is to-day more
prosperous than ever she was under the late King. Inquire
among the people, not only in Belgrade, but away in the
heart of the country where you are going. Let the people
speak for themselves, and they will tell you how far our
endeavours have been successful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And then, after half an hour’s chat, during which he told
me many interesting facts, and gave me every facility to
enable me to conduct my inquiries, I rose, shook hands, and
left, convinced that a Ministry under such a clear, level-headed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>statesman—a really great man—could not do otherwise than
raise the country into a position of wealth combined with
respect.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon every Servian’s tongue I heard the name of Pachitch,
and my own observations all showed most conclusively that
he and his party, with the concurrence of the King, are guiding
Servia to peace, happiness, and great prosperity.</p>

<p class='c001'>A few days later, while at luncheon at the house of
Dr. Vesnitch, Minister of Justice, I had an interview with
M. Stoyanovitch, the Minister of Commerce. He, like all the
other members of the Cabinet, has the interest of Servia deeply
at heart. He is dark-haired, <a id='corr156.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='midle-aged'>middle-aged</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_156.12'><ins class='correction' title='midle-aged'>middle-aged</ins></a></span>, keen, clever, and
a thoroughly competent business man. Our conversation
mainly turned upon the projected railway to unite the Danube
with San Giovanni di Medua, in Albania, and so give to Russia,
Roumania, and Servia a port on the Adriatic.</p>

<p class='c001'>The future of Servia, he declared, depended upon this
line. She must have a direct outlet for her trade, and he
prophesied that within three years the line would be built.
The cost will be about 80,000,000 francs, or 150,000 francs
per kilometre. Roughly, the length is about 500 kilometres.
He pointed out that an English company would experience
but little difficulty in obtaining a concession from the Turkish
Government to pass through Turkish territory, while a French
and German company would be prohibited. The line would
be the highroad to Russia from the south, and would be an
extremely paying one, for in addition almost the whole of
the Servian imports and exports would be carried over it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“British capitalists would do well to inquire into it,” he
said. “We have surveyed the route, and have the complete
plans at the Ministry of Public Works. To anyone introduced
by you, Monsieur N——, we should be very pleased to show
them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And the Minister went into details as to the excellent
results which must certainly accrue from the undertaking and
the profits which the company would certainly make.</p>

<p class='c001'>Servia has undoubtedly a very big future before her, and
her statesmen are ever looking far ahead.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER V <br /> TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW IN SERVIA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>A retrospect—A sitting of the Skupshtina—Peasants as deputies—Servia
as an open field for British enterprise—Enormous mineral wealth—Mr.
Finney, a mining engineer who has prospected in Servia for seventeen
years, tells me some interesting facts regarding rich mines awaiting
development—No adventurers need apply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Servia has, indeed, had a turbulent past.</p>

<p class='c001'>For centuries she has been torn by war and ground
under the heel of the oppressor. From the days of Stevan
Lazarevitch, at the end of the fourteenth century, until the
revolt of the Serbs against Turkish rule under Karageorge in
1804, the country was constantly crushed and constantly
disturbed. Karageorge declared Belgrade and the neighbouring
region the free State of Servia, which was unfortunately
not accomplished until after great sacrifices and many heroic
battles.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1813, however, while Russia was engaged in her final
conflict with Napoleon, the Turks again seized Servia, and
Karageorge with several other chiefs was exiled to Austria.
Two years later, Milosch Obrenovitch, with the aid of some
chiefs, made another struggle for liberty, which, thanks to the
Treaty of Bucharest, was crowned with success, and the
interior autonomy of Servia thus became an accomplished fact.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1842 Alexander Karageorgevitch, the younger son of
Karageorge, ascended the Servian throne as Prince, and under
his rule the government of the country was modelled upon
modern lines, and many institutions started which aided to
develop the civilisation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Exterior politics and the corruption of the officials by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>friends of the Obrenovitch were successful in creating so much
discontent that Alexander at last abandoned the throne.
Upon this, the Skupshtina, or National Assembly, elected
the aged Prince Milosch, who died very soon afterwards. In
1861 his son, Prince Mihailo, succeeded, but in 1868 was shot
at Topschider, near Belgrade, through motives of personal
animosity. His cousin Milan, who was heir to the throne,
was then in his minority, and Servia was governed by a
Regency of three persons.</p>

<p class='c001'>During Milan’s reign there occurred, 1876-78, the war
with Turkey and the securing of four new departments, the
recognition of the independence of Servia by the Berlin Treaty,
the proclamation of the kingdom in 1882, the unfortunate
war with Bulgaria in 1885, and the promulgation of a new
constitution which, with some slight modification, is still in
force. After the abdication of King Milan, his son Alexander
mounted the throne. His unfortunate matrimonial alliance
with the ambitious Draga, who quickly assumed authority,
was soon responsible for much discontent. Life became
impossible in Servia owing to the maladministration in every
department, and the army revolted, with the tragic and
regrettable result that is so well known.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the death of King Alexander in 1903, the Skupshtina
elected the son of Alexander Karageorgevitch as King under
the title of Peter I.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the present political acquisitions and the progress
already made in the highroad of civilisation, Servia has
already obtained a high place among civilised nations. But,
alas! as the Servian author, M. Zrnitch, has put it, the Servians
are only free in the head—Servia—and the arms—Montenegro.
The other parts of their organism are still
held in thraldom by the foreigner.</p>

<p class='c001'>While in Belgrade I was afforded an opportunity of
visiting the Skupshtina and being present at a somewhat
heated debate. Just before my arrival two deputies had,
it was said, come to blows. All that I saw there was most
orderly, and certainly the speakers—even those in their quaint
brown peasant dress—were mostly eloquent.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Servia badly needs a new Parliament House. The present
Skupshtina is a large bare whitewashed building with
two galleries, one for the diplomats and Press, and the
other for the public. In front of a life-sized portrait of His
Majesty sits the President, keeping order with his bell, and
on either side at baize-covered tables sit the Ministers. The
benches are set in horseshoe shape, and look very uncomfortable.
The deputies consist of all classes, from the wealthy
landowner to the peasant, and all receive fifteen francs a day
expenses while the House sits.</p>

<p class='c001'>Plans have already been prepared for a new and handsome
Parliament House, which is to be built on a fine site behind
the royal palace, and it is believed the work will be commenced
during the present year. The sooner the National
Assembly is properly housed the better, for the present
building is mostly of wood, old, rickety, and the reverse
of dignified. None are so alive to the urgent necessity of
providing comfortable quarters for the deliberations of the
Skupshtina than His Majesty himself, for it was he who
explained to me what is intended.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the revolution of June 2, 1903, the National Assembly
convoked by the Government of the kingdom of Servia gave
the country, on June 15, a new constitution, which was ratified
three days later. The Skupshtina is composed of deputies
elected directly by the people, and its members, during their
office, cannot be sued or arrested without the consent of the
Skupshtina itself—save in the case of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>flagrant delit</i></span>. Besides
the “Little Skupshtina,” which carries on the government
of the country, there is also the “Grand Skupshtina,” which
consists of double the number of deputies, and which is only
summoned in exceptional circumstances, namely, to elect
the King; to elect regents; to decide the succession of the
throne; to deliberate upon any modification of the constitution;
to decide upon any cession or exchange of territory;
or when the King wishes to consult them. The King alone
has the right to choose or dismiss his Ministers.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Servia there are 17 departments, 81 arrondissements,
and 1571 communes. At the head of each department is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>prefect nominated by the King, at the head of each arrondissement
a sous-prefect, and at the head of each commune a
mayor elected by the people.</p>

<p class='c001'>Military service is compulsory, and the number of conscripts
average 26,700 a year. The duration of service in
the active army is for cavalry and infantry two years, and
eighteen months for other branches of the service. I visited
various barracks, and was afforded several opportunities of
inspecting the troops. Both officers and men seem exceedingly
smart and capable. Many of the officers had received their
military education in France, Germany, and Russia, while
one artillery officer I met had studied at Shoeburyness!</p>

<p class='c001'>When the defensive forces are re-armed, as they will be
completely within the next twelve months, Europe will find
in Servia a very capable and well-trained army. Every Serb
is a born fighter, and no detail is being overlooked to render
Servia’s defences up to date and complete.</p>

<p class='c001'>Servia is not a country of great landowners. Apart from
the property held by the State, the land is almost wholly
divided among peasant proprietors. The law grants to every
Servian peasant 2.8 hectares of land, which cannot be sold
to pay private debts. It is also forbidden for cultivators to
give bills of exchange. These two measures are of great
importance in preserving the land to the Servian peasant.
The country is a very rich agricultural one—perhaps one of
the richest in Europe. Yet one fact struck me as curious,
namely, that in Belgrade one cannot obtain any good milk,
and all butter worth eating comes from Budapest. There is
a very great opening in Servia for dairy-farmers, a branch
of industry which, it seems, does not exist. The vines have,
in recent years, been all destroyed by the phylloxera, but
they are being rapidly replaced by the American variety.
The country around the arrondissements of Smederevo,
Golubac, Ram, and Krayina are particularly noted for good
grapes and excellent wine.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tobacco is a monopoly of the State. It is purchased
upon a tariff fixed by special commission, and is of well-known
quality and peculiarly adapted for the manufacture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>of cigarettes. The departments where it is principally cultivated
are Vranya, Krayina, Nisch, d’Uzice, and Kragooyevac,
while in other parts of Servia the Turkish varieties are grown
with great success, and for aroma will compare well with the
tobacco of Albania or Kavala. Not only is sufficient tobacco
grown in Servia to supply the wants of the country, but the
quantities exported are increasing year by year. A favoured
few Englishmen, and especially diplomats in various parts
of Europe—who know the excellence of the special quality
of Servian cigarettes—have them direct from Belgrade.
Cigarettes bought for export cost one-half the price they do
for consumption in Servia.</p>

<p class='c001'>Marmalade and <span lang="mk" xml:lang="mk"><i>slivovitza</i></span>—an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>eau-de-vie</i></span> made of prunes—are
also two articles manufactured in Servia and largely
exported, about three million francs’ worth of the former,
and two hundred thousand francs’ worth of the latter being
sent out of the country annually.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are immense forests in various parts of the country
with a great wealth of timber unexploited, as a glance at
any good map of Servia will show, while the sportsman will
find there plenty of game of every kind, from bear, lynx,
wolf, and such-like animals, down to the quail, pigeon, partridge,
pheasant, and woodcock. The whole country teems
with game, and the only prohibitions are upon the stag, deer,
chamois, and hen pheasants. There are many sporting clubs,
the chief one being in Belgrade, where a paper is also published
called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Le Chasseur</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Servia’s mineral wealth is well known to geologists. Gold,
in diluvial and alluvial deposits, is being worked at Timok,
at Pek, and at other places, while cinnabar is found at Avala,
near Belgrade, and in the villages of Brajici, Bare, and Donja
Tresnica. At Podrinye, at Lyuta Strana, at Zuce, at Crveni
Breg, in the region of Avala, at Rudnik, at Kopaonik, at
Djurina Sreca there is lead; at Zavlaca and Kucajna, zinc;
and at Povlen, Suvobor, Cemerno, Aldinac, Majdanpek, Bor
in Timok and Rtanj, large deposits of copper. Arsenic is
found in various regions, but principally near Donja Tresnica,
in the department of Podrinye; while antimony is known to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>exist in the Zajaca region. Rich iron is waiting to be exploited
upon the Kopaonik, in Vlasina, Rudna Glava, Crnajka
(department of Krajina), on the Vencac, in the centre of
Servia, and on the Boranja (in Podrinye); while there is coal
in places too innumerable to mention in this work.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this enormous mineral wealth might well be exploited
by British capital. The Servian Government are, however,
very careful to whom they give concessions, and will not
entertain, for a single moment, any application, unless the
applicant is properly introduced and can give undeniable
proof of his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bona fides</i></span>. Therefore the adventurer who thinks
he will, without capital, be able to make a “good thing” will
find himself sadly disappointed. The Government is extremely
anxious to receive <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bona-fide</i></span> proposals, and as His
Majesty himself informed me, will grant concessions, but only to
firms or companies who mean serious and legitimate business.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Servian State is owner of all the subsoil of its territory,
and can give what rights it thinks proper to foreigners to
prospect and work.</p>

<p class='c001'>British capitalists would do well to make inquiries, for,
from certain information I gathered in Belgrade, I have
no hesitation in saying that great returns await those who
commence serious mining operations in that rich and inexhaustible
field.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the future wealth of Servia will depend to a large
extent on the exploitation of her mineral resources, and as
Englishmen must, ere long, be interested in her mines—as
they are in mines all over the world—a few facts concerning
the Mining Law of Servia may not be out of place here.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Government grants two kinds of rights to make
researches, the “simple right” and the “exclusive right.”
The former is given for one year, and may be extended to
two years, and is limited to the three communes indicated.
The second lasts a year, but is renewable each year as long
as required, and it gives a right to explore over 500,000 square
metres of mining field.</p>

<p class='c001'>The State gives concessions for mines for fifty years upon
a sufficient number of mining-fields each of 100,000 square
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>metres, the boundaries of which are fixed by a special commission.
To obtain a concession it must first be proved
that there are undoubted traces of minerals; that the capital
is sufficient, and a plan of the proposed works has to be
furnished. The concessionaire, after fifteen years of uninterrupted
work, becomes proprietor, but he must continue
to pay the mining duties, and of course conform to the
Mining Law.</p>

<p class='c001'>Both the prospector and the concessionaire are obliged to
work regularly, take proper precautions for the well-being
and personal safety of their workpeople, report annually upon
work executed, and furnish each year plans for next year’s
work. There must be no mining beneath roads, water-courses,
buildings, or cemeteries.</p>

<p class='c001'>All rights of research and all concessions are lost if the
specified work is not executed within the first year, or is
interrupted without a reason approved by the Minister, or
by bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The State, in order to encourage industry, favours the
importation of all machinery and material for use in mines,
as well as the exportation of the ore obtained, and gives
many other advantages to the concessionaire.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of late, Belgrade has been overrun with foreign concession-hunters,
most of them of the adventurer type. I
met several of them in Belgrade. In my conversation with
the Ministers I quickly learnt that the Government, fully
alive to the great mineral resources of their country, and
confident in the great wealth that must in a few years accrue,
will have absolutely nothing to do with any person who comes
to them without introduction.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Belgrade, I repeat, the doors are closed to the irresponsible
concession-hunter, but at once open to anyone who
on being introduced can show his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bona fides</i></span> and that he has
capital behind him.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the course of my inquiries into the mineral wealth
I had a number of conversations with Mr. J. R. Finney,
Ass. I. M. &amp; M., an English mining engineer who has spent
seventeen years in prospecting and working mines in Servia.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>No one knows more about mines and traces of minerals
in the country than he.</p>

<p class='c001'>He pointed out to me that the mineral deposits of Servia
have been worked to a very great extent from very early
times, as the remains of Roman and Venetian works prove
and the enormous slag-heaps found in various parts of the
country. He himself has on many occasions found, while
prospecting, rude ancient implements, bones, etc. Of the
ancient Roman workings, copper, galena, and silver were
obtained at Kopaonik; at Rudnik, lead, silver, and zinc were
mined; at Kucajna, gold, silver, zinc, and coal, while alluvial
gold is to be found all along the Pek River, and especially
where it joins the Danube. This gold has, he said, evidently
been worked down in course of time from a rich quartz
reef which is known by certain persons, including himself,
to exist.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the Rebel copper mine, which Mr. Finney himself discovered,
he found ancient workings that had been shored
up with timber, but so long ago that the wood was petrified!
Again, the wood was pine, which does not now exist in the
forests. The latter are all beeches, and it is known that in
course of long ages beeches kill the pines. At the mine in
question is an extensive copper-smelting works, and a very
large percentage of metal is obtained. All over this same
district Mr. Finney has prospected, and declares that in
the mountains of Medvednick and Povlen there are large
deposits of lead, copper, silver, and antimony all awaiting
exploitation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some very important copper mines and smelting works
are at Maydan Pek, and have been worked at a good profit
for years, while at Bor there has been erected a large smelting
works, which are capable of producing ten tons of copper daily.
Large deposits of antimony exist, to Mr. Finney’s knowledge,
at Zajitchar and Krupanj.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I quite admit,” said Mr. Finney, as we were chatting,
“that some mines in Servia have not been successful. The
bulk of them have been over-capitalised. Take, as an instance,
one company with £300,000 capital, which left £20,000 for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>working. The consequence is that the sum at disposal has
not been sufficient to develop the mine or to work sufficient
to pay interest on £280,000.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Again, in many cases men unacquainted with any foreign
language, or with the customs of the country, have been sent
out here to manage, and with instructions from a board in
London utterly ignorant of the requirements of the case. As
an instance of this, a certain company that I could name
sent out to Servia six managers in three years. In such a
case, with a manager dependent upon interpreters and
ignorant of the people, the price of labour and materials rises
from 200 to 300 per cent. I have known these prices to be
paid. Again, there is some little reform needed in the mining
laws, and the Government would be well advised if they
compelled the communes to put the roads in better repair.
Transport is at present somewhat difficult, and if the communes
put the roads in order they would, in the long-run,
greatly benefit by the opening up of the country. Such,”
Mr. Finney added, “are some of the reasons why foreign
mining undertakings in Servia have not been altogether successful
in the past. But for the future there is great hope,
and English capitalists will do well to regard Servia as a
field where good profits may easily be made.”</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER I <br /> SOFIA OF TO-DAY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>At the Bulgarian frontier—A chat with M. Etienne, French ex-Minister of
War—Evening in Sofia—A city of rapid progress—Engaging peasants
for Earl’s Court Exhibition—Amusing episodes—Social life in Sofia—The
diplomats’ club—The Bulgarian Government grant me special
facilities for investigation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Orient Express—that train of dusty <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>wagons-lits</i></span> which
three days a week gives communication between Ostend
and the East—had just passed the Bulgarian frontier at Tzaribrod,
and my passport had been examined and stamped by
a keen-eyed little man in black.</p>

<p class='c001'>I was sitting in the dining-car with a very distinguished
French statesman, M. Etienne, ex-Minister of War, and we
had been chatting for several hours as the train wound through
the defiles of the Servian mountains.</p>

<p class='c001'>A diplomat’s wife, with four pet spaniels, on her way,
I believe, from Japan to the Turkish capital, was seated at
the next table to ours. She had ordered coffee, for which she
paid with a thousand-franc French note! The takings of
the “pudding-car” of the “Orient” must be considerable,
for the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>maître d’hôtel</i></span> promptly cashed the note—nine “one-hundreds,”
some French gold, silver, and copper—and received
a few centimes as a tip! It was my first quaint experience
in Bulgaria. Mark Twain with his million-pound-note should
come here. Curiously enough, I afterwards met the diplomat’s
wife in Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c001'>Entering Sofia from the station, the traveller is at first
sadly disappointed. The place looks dismal and half finished.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>There are wide roads and boulevards laid out, with scarcely
a house in them. Your cab suddenly turns a corner. The
high pointed minaret of a mosque comes into view, and lo!
you are in a wide boulevard, which would really do credit
to Brussels. You pass a many-domed building, the Cathedral,
and presently a pretty garden behind railings, and a long
handsome building with sentries at the entrance-gate—the
Palace of Prince Ferdinand. You are in modern Sofia.</p>

<p class='c001'>After a wash at the hotel, I went to the Palace, signed my
name in His Royal Highness’s visiting-book, and then went
forth to wander in the streets.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was now already dark. In the trees of the central
boulevard thousands of rooks were cawing and circling above,
disturbed by the lights and movement of the street. Men
were shouting the evening newspapers in strident voices, and
one could almost imagine oneself back on the Boulevard
des Italiens at the absinthe hour, with the camelots crying
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>V’la la Presse!</i></span>” Only, in Paris, rooks do not nest in the
streets, nor do the watchmakers have twenty-four inches of
space and a chair in the windows of the smaller cafés. A
walk along any of the principal streets at once shows the
Bulgar to be a fighter, for the display of arms of all kinds,
even to the modern Browning automatic pistol, is immense.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, one is really in the Balkans. The last official census
gives sixty-six Englishmen and forty-six Englishwomen in
the whole of Bulgaria. I met six only. Uniforms, upon
Russian models, are everywhere—the peaked cap, the grey
overcoat, the big revolver. Men in European dress jostle
with peasants in linen blouses, round astrachan caps, and
drab blankets around them, or others in sheepskin jackets
with the wool inside, all with the inevitable round Balkan
cap of astrachan. The Turk, too, is quite at home and
friendly with the Christian, and modern progress is typified
by the electric trams whizzing and clanging everywhere.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Old Mosque: Sofia.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Sofia is essentially a town of progress. During the past
eighteen months whole streets of new villas have sprung up
upon its outskirts, and such a rush has there lately been for
building plots that our Foreign Office—who want to build
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>a new Legation—are unable to get any decent site in a central
position. Sofia is just now in the transition stage. Great
new public buildings and fine boulevards are springing up
everywhere. There is a beautiful new theatre, a new post
office, a new Agricultural Bank, and hosts of minor structures,
all spacious and well built, which, in themselves, show Bulgaria
to be a country of rapid advancement.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unlike some other Balkan countries, there seems no lack
of money here. Just now, for example, it is proposed to expend
a little matter of fourteen million francs upon roads in
the Principality, and the cost of the new market-halls and
other buildings will probably be prodigious.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the Bulgar is essentially a thrifty person. During
the past twenty years he has transformed his capital from a
wretched little Turkish town into a really handsome city.
In twenty years to come, at the present rate of progress, it
will be the Brussels of the East, for it is modelled upon the
same plan.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sofia is a city of quaint contrasts. Fine modern shops,
where one can obtain the latest Parisian perfumes, the latest
French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>modes</i></span>, or expensive table delicacies, are hopelessly
mixed up with the Turkish stalls where sallow-faced men
are squatting at work, or sitting pensively at the seat of
custom. The Sofia tradesman likes to expose his wares,
whatever they may be, in the street, for in that he still retains
the trace of the trade manners of the Turk. The pavements
of the main streets are heaped with wares—fish in barrels,
meat, groceries, live fowls, live pigs tied to lamp-posts, and
among it all jostle the passers-by.</p>

<p class='c001'>The broad Maria Luisa Ulitza, the Dondukoff Boulevard,
or the Pirotska Ulitza are, on a Friday, the market-day,
crowded with peasants in the most picturesque costume of
all the Balkans. Until a year or two ago the skirts and head-dresses
were of white linen embroidered, but in these modern
times the women dye all their white clothes a pale blue.
Therefore they all seem to wear the same delicate shade.
The married women have their heads covered with a pale
blue handkerchief, and wear a heavy silver girdle; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>village maidens all have their hair parted in the middle and
hanging in a hundred small plaits with sequins down their
backs, while over the left ear they wear a bunch of fresh
flowers, which gives them a most coquettish appearance. The
skirt is short, always hand-embroidered, and sometimes
studded with gold sequins, while over all is worn a short
jacket of sheepskin with the wool inside, rendering them
somewhat podgy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The men from the country, a fine tall race, wear embroidered
costumes, the jackets of dark stuff flowered in
pale blue and ornamented with hundreds of pearl buttons,
tight white trousers embroidered at the knees, and the inevitable
round cap, without which no Bulgar is complete.</p>

<p class='c001'>I spent one amusing morning with Mr. James Bourchier,
the well-known Balkan correspondent of the <cite>Times</cite>, who is
six months each year resident in Sofia. He was on the local
committee of the Balkan Exhibition at Earl’s Court while
I was on the London committee, and our mission was to
discover in the market some good-looking peasant girls to
go to the wilds of West Kensington. He had already been
to several villages, but the girls, he said, were rather chary of
going so far from home, even though assured by their local
Mayor of their well-being and safe return.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the particular day of our visit to the market my
journalistic friend had arranged to meet the Mayor of one
of the neighbouring villages—a peasant—and with his aid
try induce some of the best-looking girls to grace the
Bulgarian Section of the Exhibition. The village Mayor
being prevented from joining us, we determined to start
upon a voyage of discovery ourselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a rather formidable undertaking. We, however,
spent an amusing morning; but though we talked with many
comely girls with flowers in their hair, we somehow were
unable to impress any of them with the advantages of a
free trip to London. Unfortunately, they did not take us
at all seriously; there was a good deal of tittering at our
proposals, and the market with its vegetables, its sucking-pigs
on strings, and its turkeys tied head downwards on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>cross-sticks, was drawn blank. We could only hope that
next Friday, with the presence of the confidence-inspiring
Mayor, we might be more successful.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>His Excellency Dr. Dimitri Stancioff</span>,<br />Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>As a matter of fact, a few days later, accompanied by
my friend, M. Dimitri Stancioff, of the Commercial Department
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and M. Mandersheff,
another functionary from the same Ministry, we took carriages
out to the picturesque village of Vladaja, some seventeen
kilometres from Sofia on the broad highroad that leads to
Kustendil and Macedonia. The drive was a delightful one
in the bright winter sunshine, through a fertile undulating
country, until, turning off from the well-kept military road,
we found ourselves in a small village lying in a deep dark
ravine.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here the costumes were very quaint and interesting,
the men in long blouses of white blanket-like woollen stuff
trimmed with black, raw-hide shoes, and their legs bound
with leather thongs; while the women and girls wore gay
colours, short lace-edged petticoats, and quantities of gold
sequins and coins about their necks. Some of those strings
of coins were worth at least from fifteen to twenty pounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our journey of investigation was distinctly humorous.
Sometimes the four of us could not agree as to the personal
beauty of a fair candidate for the approbation of the British
public, while those we spoke to were mostly shy to answer
our questions. Many of the village girls flatly refused to
leave their homes unless their lovers were also employed in
the Exhibition, but after much explanation, a good deal of
chaff, and considerable giggling, the names of several were
taken in order that inquiries should be made of the village
Mayor before the presentation and signature of their agreement,
which provided for their fare to London, the payment
of their wages, their insurance for the benefit of their family
in case of accident, and their safe return to Bulgaria at the
termination of the Exhibition.</p>

<p class='c001'>We engaged one flute-player—a tall, dark-faced young
giant in sheepskins—after he had displayed his aptness
with his instrument. The local <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>han</i></span>, wherein we rested,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>drank <span lang="sq" xml:lang="sq"><i>rakhi</i></span>, and ate cream-cheese, was a big common room
with earthen floor. In the centre was a large stove, upon
which was cooking some steaming dish with appetising
odour. Around us sat dozens of huge burly fellows, bulky
in their sheepskins, gossiping and drinking wine, a fierce-looking
assembly, to be sure, and yet withal extremely good-humoured.</p>

<p class='c001'>After a while, the village musician was discovered, a short
little fellow who played a quaint kind of two-stringed violin,
and almost as soon as he sounded the weird, plaintive music,
young girls with flowers entwined in their long plaited tresses,
and others, slightly older, with the white handkerchiefs on
their heads—the badge of matrimony—came trooping forth
to perform for us the national dance—the <span lang="bg" xml:lang="bg"><i>horo</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Forming in a line, the youths and maidens crossed arms,
linked their hands in each other’s belts, and then began a
curious kind of dance, keeping step with the music and ever
advancing and retreating, keeping it up for a full half-hour.
Now and then the tune was changed, and with the tune the
dance.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the clear Eastern afterglow of evening, with the thin
crescent moon slowly rising, it was a quaint and curious
scene. The weird music, the strange costumes, the cries of
the dancers, and the merry laughter of the girls, will long
live within my memory as a picture worthy the brush of a
great painter.</p>

<p class='c001'>And as we drove back to Sofia through the silent, starlit
night, I wondered what impression those simple-minded folk,
so far removed from Western civilisation, would receive of
our fairy-lamps, pasteboard, tinsel, imitation mountains,
brass bands, and water-chute at Earl’s Court!</p>

<p class='c001'>What would be the stories of their adventures in West
Kensington and the wonders of London when they returned
to remote Vladaja?</p>

<p class='c001'>I had, like every other Englishman, always regarded
Bulgaria as a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>terra incognita</i></span>, where local manufactures were
absent and where most goods were imported. Therefore a
surprise awaited me one day when Monsieur M. V. Lascoff,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Director of the Bulgarian Commercial and Industrial Museum
at Sofia, took me round that institution, and showed me
specimens of the various goods produced in the country. In
the museum was a most wonderful collection of articles
representing the manufactures of Bulgaria, ranging from
violins to soap, and from table-covers manufactured from
beautifully embroidered jacket sleeves to writing-ink and
tinned fruits.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the prominent industries is the distillation of
otto-of-roses in the Shipka district, where in summer the whole
country is covered with blossom, an industry to which I
will devote a chapter. Carpets, very similar to the dark
crimson-and-blue Persian varieties, and goat-hair floor-coverings
are made largely by the peasantry, who also weave by
hand wonderfully fine gauzes, tissues, and dress-stuffs. Felt
hats, blankets, pottery, and copies of antique filigree jewellery
are also of peasant manufacture, and are really wonderfully
done. The stranger has no idea, until shown this museum,
of the rapid progress the country is making commercially.</p>

<p class='c001'>While passing round the museum I chanced to admire
two pairs of very fine antique silver earrings of rare design
worn by the Bulgarian peasants two centuries ago, whereupon
the case was at once opened, and they were presented to me
as a little souvenir of my visit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sofia, being a brand-new city, is not, of course, quite
perfect. It requires, among other things, a good system of
drainage and the repavement of its streets. The latter work
is to be commenced in a few months’ time. A good first-class
hotel, too, is also badly required. At present the hotels,
though clean, are poor and comfortless, and neither they
nor the restaurants do credit to the go-ahead character of
the progressive Bulgarians. All this, however, will soon be
remedied, for I heard of schemes for new hotels with fine
restaurants and winter-gardens. So in six months’ time the
traveller may expect to be in the full enjoyment of them,
for in Sofia they do not talk, but act.</p>

<p class='c001'>If you are anywhere in the Balkans and mention Sofia,
you will be told, with a sigh of regret, “Ah! they have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>club there. We haven’t.” I had heard this in Belgrade, in
Sarayevo, in Ragusa, in Cettinje—in fact, everywhere throughout
the Balkans; therefore, with some curiosity I entered
the sacred portals of the much-talked-of club with my friend
Colonel Hubert du Cane, the British military attaché, and
was elected a member during my stay in the Bulgarian capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>It certainly is a most excellent and comfortable club—one
of the best I know of on the whole of the Continent. The
rooms are cosy and artistic, and the members are most diplomats,
Cabinet Ministers, and high functionaries of the State.
At lunch, representatives of most of the European Powers
assemble at the long table and chat merrily, while at dinner,
at the small table at the end, M. Petkoff,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c024'><sup>[1]</sup></a> the Premier; Dr.
Dimitri Stancioff, the Foreign Minister; and several other
members of the Cabinet, dine nightly at “the Ministers’ table.”</p>

<hr class='c025' />
<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. M. Petkoff has, since the present work has been in the press, been
assassinated while walking in the Boris Garden in Sofia.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c025' />

<p class='c001'>The food is excellent, though there are, of course, some
grumblers, and the whole institution is conducted on similar
lines to a first-class London club. Perhaps the custom of
personally introducing the stranger to every single member
of the club strikes the foreigner as a little unnecessary, yet
without doubt there is real good-fellowship existing, such as
is entirely absent in some other clubs I know—the English
Club in Brussels and the Florence Club in Florence, in particular.</p>

<p class='c001'>Men, and especially the diplomats, find it a very great
boon, for to go to Sofia is to find a real good club and quite
a host of good cosmopolitan friends ever ready to show the
stranger all kinds of hospitality.</p>

<p class='c001'>Social life is far from dull. Sport and games of every kind
are most popular. There is an excellent tennis club, hockey
is played three or four times a week, and large riding parties,
personally conducted by Baron Rubin de Cervin, the Italian
military attaché, go out for long jaunts into the neighbouring
mountains several times each week. Then at night there are
constant dinners and receptions at the Legations, and everyone
seems to lead a very pleasant life, without a moment’s dulness.</p>

<div id='i188'  class='figcenter id004'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>His Excellency D. Petkoff</span>,<br />Prime Minister of Bulgaria.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Lady Buchanan, wife of Sir George Buchanan, the British
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Minister, is the principal hostess, and with her daughter is
foremost in Sofia society. Until ill-health prevented her
recently, she was an ardent player of hockey and tennis, and
constantly in the saddle. Her entertainments are always
brilliant, and in her pretty salon one meets everyone who is
anyone in Sofia.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, the Military Club is another centre of social life.
The building is a handsome one, with an extremely fine ballroom,
where dances, given every week through the season,
are attended by the elite of Sofia. I went to one, and
found it a particularly gay and brilliant function.</p>

<p class='c001'>Government institutions in Sofia amazed me. They
would do credit to any European capital. The Agricultural
Bank, the inner working of which I was permitted by Monsieur
N. Ghenadieff, Minister of Commerce, to inspect, is a fine
new building of huge dimensions, with a beautifully ornamented
board-room, and its operations no doubt tend much
towards securing the public prosperity of Bulgaria. M.
Seraphimoff, the Governor, who conducted me round, told
me that the bank had its origin in the time of the Turkish
rule. As far back as 1863, the Governor of the <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayet</i></span> of
the Danube created small banks in order to aid the peasants,
the villagers repaying their loans in crops and the banks
selling the produce.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the Russo-Turkish War, however, many of these
banks lost their capital, for the Turkish functionaries escaped
with all the funds they could place their hands upon. The
Provisional Russian Government re-established the banks,
and they have continued to progress until the present institution
was founded. It now has eighty-five branch offices in
the principal towns and agents in most of the villages. Its
direction is under a governor and four directors nominated
by Prince Ferdinand. The operations of the institution are
as follows: to accept deposits; to grant loans on mortgages
or securities; to grant loans upon cattle and agricultural
produce; to advance money to the peasants for the purchase
of cattle, seeds, or agricultural implements; to make personal
loans; to open current accounts with peasants; to buy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>agricultural implements, seeds, and machinery for the peasants;
to accept loans for departments or communes; and for the
transfer of securities. The interest charged or given is 5
per cent. for deposits for five years, 4 per cent. for three years,
and 3 per cent. for one year. In 1901 the amount of the
bank’s operations was 535,575,182 francs, while in 1905 it
amounted to 1,180,778,378 francs, thus showing how greatly
it is appreciated by the peasant, and of what enormous benefit
it is to the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>While there, I saw many uncouth peasants in their sheepskins
from far-distant villages come and obtain loans, repay
their interest, or make petition for their inability to pay.
It is very apparent that all of them greatly appreciate the
fact that the Government is their creditor and not the Jews.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another institution which I inspected was the State
printing press, a fine building containing the latest machinery;
and afterwards I was shown the building of the magnificent
new church of St. Alexander Newsky, which, being constructed
in blocks of white stone just behind the old church of St.
Sophia, is costing over three million francs, and is to be in
memory of the Russian liberator of Bulgaria.</p>

<p class='c001'>Truly, everywhere one turns in Sofia one sees some new
buildings, for signs of rapid progress and up-to-dateness are
on every hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bulgaria, with Servia, is surely destined to expand in
the near future, and the “big Bulgaria” must some day ere
long be an accomplished fact.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> BULGARIA AS A FIELD FOR BRITISH <br /> ENTERPRISE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Audiences of members of the Bulgarian Cabinet—Dr. Dimitri Stancioff, Minister
for Foreign Affairs, the coming man of Bulgaria—His policy—Facts
about the mineral wealth and mining laws—Advice to traders and
capitalists by the British Vice-Consul in Sofia—Our methods as compared
with those of other nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the objects of my observations being to point out
where British capital can, with advantage and security,
be employed in the Balkans, I made, while in Sofia, very
careful and exhaustive inquiry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Information was given me by the late Premier, M. D. Petkoff;
the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Dimitri Stancioff;
and by M. Ghenadieff, the Minister of Commerce, who was
also interesting himself very actively in the Balkan Exhibition
at Earl’s Court. To these three members of the Bulgarian
Cabinet, and to His Royal Highness Prince Ferdinand himself,
I have to acknowledge my thanks for placing all information
at my disposal. The Minister for Foreign Affairs deputed
his cousin, Monsieur D. M. Stancioff, of the Commercial
Department of the Ministry, to accompany me everywhere
and explain everything. I was given a perfectly free hand
to go when and where I liked, and, as His Excellency put it,
“to see Bulgaria just as I pleased.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Bulgarians are nothing if not thoroughly businesslike.
I was particularly requested by the Ministers not to
paint the country in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>couleur de rose</i></span>. One member of the
Cabinet said, as I stood in the corner of the ballroom of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Military Club one night, “We would like the English to
know exactly what they can find in Bulgaria, and how we
shall treat them. Don’t flatter us, and cause English capitalists
to expect too much. We have good paying investments for
them—if they will only come here.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I took a good deal of trouble in going very minutely into
this very important question, and found the Government
ready and eager to give every facility to British capitalists
to exploit the great mineral wealth in their country. The
mining laws are just, and extremely favourable to secure
absolute rights to those who invest. The Government have
established in Sofia a Mining Department under the Ministry
of Commerce, where specimens of ore may be seen, and where
every information can be obtained. By the courtesy of
M. T. Michailowsky, the able Director of this Department, I
was afforded an opportunity of inspecting the various collections,
and was given much information of intense interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems that up to the present time the Government
have given thirty-one concessions, mostly to French, Russian,
Belgian, and Italian capitalists. Of these, sixteen are for
coal, four for copper, two for manganese, two for iron, two
for lead, two for zinc, and one for oil-bearing minerals. There
are no English companies in Bulgaria at present, but I was informed
by the Minister of Commerce that the greatest attention
would be paid to any serious application from England.
There are known to exist in the district of Bourgas, on the
Black Sea, very rich copper deposits, also in the Vraza district,
and in Belogradjik, near the Danube.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two kinds of “permits for research” are granted by the
Government. The first—a general one to search in any part
of Bulgaria—is given free, but with a personal guarantee that
any damage done will be made good. The second is a permit
for a special place, which must not be of greater extent than
8,000,000 square metres, and for this is charged eighty francs.
This lasts for two years. After this time, if a concession is
desired, the Department make inquiries in order to see if
the proposed mine bears sufficient to justify its working.
This having been decided—which takes about a month, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>at most two—the Prince issues a decree, and the concession
is granted for ever. No deposit is required, but the Government
takes, for each hectare, three francs per annum for coals, and
four francs per annum for minerals. They also tax the output
at the rate of one per cent. Machinery and material enter
the country free of duty, and as far as I was able to judge,
the Bulgarians make excellent workmen, being very sober,
industrious, and obedient. At present, however, there is
large emigration, for there is not sufficient work for the four
and a half millions of people in the country.</p>

<div id='i192'  class='figcenter id004'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>His Excellency N. Ghenadieff</span>, Bulgarian Minister of Commerce.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>One colliery is worked by the Government at Pernik, and
this supplies the railways, the city of Sofia, and the many
industrial enterprises with about 200,000 tons of excellent
coal yearly. All the other mines are just starting to work,
and show prospects of splendid profits.</p>

<p class='c001'>The copper mine at Vraza, which is exploited by Monsieur
Maurocordato of Constantinople—who has invested about
600,000 francs—has, in two years, repaid itself, thus showing
that there are mines in Bulgaria, and very rich ones indeed.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the concessions already granted show great futures,
but unfortunately, with the exception of the Vraza enterprise,
the concessionaires lack capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Bulgarian Mining Law is a very liberal one, being
an exception to the laws of most other countries, for it has
been drawn up specially to induce the investment of foreign
capital, as well as to secure the interests of shareholders. The
people of Bulgaria are not rich enough to exploit their mines
themselves, and for that reason the mining industry of the
country must of necessity be in the hands of the foreigner.</p>

<p class='c001'>When making my inquiries, M. R. S. Kossef, Director of
the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
was most particular that I should say nothing that was not
absolutely true regarding the mines. “We do not wish to
attract capitalists to Bulgaria by means of advertisement,”
he said. “We wish them to know that they will here find
a good return for their investments, and that if they exploit
our mines, we, on our part, will treat them justly—even
generously.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Besides minerals, Bulgaria is extremely rich in mineral
springs—the one at Banki, seventeen kilometres from Sofia,
being about to be exploited this year, when a very handsome
bath establishment and hotel are to be constructed. The
source is situated in the valley beneath the Lubin mountain,
and an automobile service is to be established with Sofia.
This spring gives 1200 litres a minute, and has been pronounced
by a number of first-class authorities in Germany
and France to be a water almost unexcelled in Europe. Other
springs abound all over the country, and so important are
they, indeed, that the Government have issued a large coloured
map of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Sofia itself, close to the old mosque, are well-known
sulphur baths. There is a project for building a bath establishment,
but to do so it would mean the pulling down of
the mosque in question. The Turks would not object so
much if a new mosque could be built, but it seems that the
difficulties of construction are very great, so for the present
the matter remains in abeyance.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the whole of Bulgaria over two hundred thermal and
mineral springs are known, and they are situated in eighty
different districts. The department of Sofia alone contains
twenty-three, the warmest being at Dolna-Banja. The more
important of the others are at Kniajevo, Gorva, Banja, and
Pantcherevo. Then there are the renowned warm springs at
Verschetz, in the department of Vratza, while in the department
of Plovdiv (Philippopoli) there are more than forty springs,
the principal of them being at Hissar. This, perhaps the
most reputed in all the Orient, is situated in the valley
of Tchepino, in the centre of the Rhodopes Mountains. At
Lidji, near Bourgas, and at Sliven, there are establishments
on the latest modern principle. Another which is being
actively exploited is the waters of Meritchteri, in Stara-Zagora,
which are declared by analysts to be quite equal to
those of Carlsbad, and which are believed to have a great
future before them. Dr. Ernst Hintz, of Wiesbaden, has
written a book upon these particular waters, and has given
exhaustive analyses.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>There are also minor waters in the town of Kustendil
and in dozens of other villages and towns all over Bulgaria.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, to encourage intending pioneers of new branches
of industry, it is interesting to note that the industries in
actual existence are making great progress. The numerous
spinning mills and cloth factories in Eastern Roumelia have
been enlarged, while the Varna Cotton Mill, whose headquarters
are in Manchester, employs nearly seven hundred
hands, and in 1905 paid a dividend of 10 per cent.</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards British trade in Bulgaria, the attention of the
English manufacturer has been repeatedly drawn, in trade
reports from the Consulate in Sofia, to the energetic measures
adopted by foreign competitors to secure the Bulgarian
market for themselves. As Germany’s rivalry is by far the
most formidable, it may be well to briefly illustrate the methods
by which that country is steadily absorbing the trade of the
Near East, as explained to me by Mr. Toulmin, British Vice-Consul
in Sofia. Not only do the principal German importers
have capable agents established in the more important towns
throughout Bulgaria to push the sale of their goods, but they
also send at regular intervals experienced travellers who
thoroughly investigate the commercial condition of the country
in its various trade centres, take note of the wants and requirements
of the population, and enter into direct relations
with the retail trader. They are, moreover, instructed to
do business at any cost, and are authorised to give credit
for a year or even longer. By their readiness to accept the
smallest order, by scrupulously adhering to conditions and
specifications, and by strictly supplying goods according to
sample approved, German importers are now reaping the
fruits of a painstaking and methodical commercial policy,
which menaces even Austria-Hungary’s hitherto unassailed
supremacy. The importance, therefore, of sending out to
Bulgaria representatives with some knowledge of French or
German cannot be too strongly impressed on British manufacturers.
It may be well to mention that a gentleman,
representing a well-known Birmingham firm dealing in hardware,
called at the Consulate at Sofia a few months ago, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>expressed himself as highly satisfied with the result of his
fortnight’s business tour in Bulgaria.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the employment of commercial travellers, the translation
of their catalogues, if not into Bulgarian, at any rate
into French or German, the use of the metric system of weights
and measures, the conversion of sterling into francs and
centimes, and by giving longer credit—by these means only
can British merchants hope to compete successfully with
their foreign rivals.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER III <br /> WILL BULGARIA DECLARE WAR?</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>A sitting of the Sobranje—Declarations by the Prime Minister and Dr.
Stancioff—The new Minister of Foreign Affairs—A sound progressive
government—Strong army and firm policy—Will the deplorable state
of Macedonia still be tolerated?—Ominous words.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a bitterly cold November evening when, accompanied
by Sir George Buchanan, I entered the Sobranje,
or Bulgarian Parliament, to hear the Ministerial statement
upon the future policy of Bulgaria and her attitude towards
Turkey.</p>

<p class='c001'>A great high-roofed square chamber, enamelled entirely
in white and picked out with gold. At one end a high, red-carpeted
daïs with the throne, behind which hung a full-length
portrait of Prince Ferdinand. Upon an escutcheon
above, the Bulgarian lion on a crimson shield. Below the
empty throne, a long red-covered table, where sat the President,
a short, grey-haired little man, who from time to time
rang a musical gong; and in the arena, on a scarlet carpet,
rows of horse-shoe benches half filled by deputies. On the
right, at a table placed at an angle, sat the Ministers. First
was Monsieur Petkoff, the Prime Minister, the most prominent
man in Bulgaria, and who has, alas! since shared the fate of
his friend the late Stambouloff; next Dr. Stancioff, the newly
appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs; the Minister of War
in a dark blue uniform with a white cross at his throat; and
the Ministers of Justice, Commerce, and Finance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Above, around three sides of the huge white-and-gold
hall, the galleries were crowded by the public, while over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>all big arc lamps shed their white brilliancy. With us in
the diplomats’ gallery sat the Prince’s confidential secretary,
M. Dobrovitch, the German Minister, the representatives of
Turkey and Roumania, Colonel H. du Cane, the British
military attaché, and numbers of other diplomats.</p>

<p class='c001'>The House was silent. Every ear was strained to catch
the Premier’s words, for it was he who was now speaking.
A rather short, grey-bearded figure, just past the prime,
whose left hand as he gesticulated only showed a stump. He
lost it at the Shipka, and as patriot and politician he was leader
of his party—a party of progress, that has been four years
in power with an overwhelming majority.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the past four hours he had been speaking fluently,
easily, without interruption, forecasting the future policy
of Bulgaria—the policy which is designed to lead the country
to prosperity. Bulgaria had long waited for this, and every
word was now being listened to with rapt attention.</p>

<p class='c001'>On those benches below sat representatives of the people,
men of every class—lawyers, shopkeepers, peasants in their
white linen or brown homespun suits, and even Turks. Surely
this Sobranje is essentially a representative gathering.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now and then came a spontaneous outburst of applause,
very marked when the Prime Minister dwelt upon the cordial
relations with Roumania and their identical aims with regard
to Macedonia. Everyone applauded—all save one little
section of benches on the extreme left—a mere handful of
men—the Opposition. So small are they that they really
do not seem to count. Nobody took any notice of them. With
their backs to the holy ikon of burnished gold and highly
finished religious pictures, they sat facing the Ministers, who
were, of course, ever confronted by the emblem of their faith.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Gen. Michael Savoff</span>, Bulgarian Minister of War.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This speech, being in Bulgarian, was kindly translated
to me by M. Dobrovitch, the Prince’s private secretary. He
said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“To-day neither the Macedonian people nor Bulgaria
nor Turkey are the same states which they were fifteen years
ago. In consideration of the solution of the Macedonian
question, we have to reckon with several factors. The most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>important of them is that we ought to be ready at a moment’s
notice. We have to be strong! Europe acts and reforms in
Macedonia. No Bulgarian Government can foresee what to
expect or how the events will develop themselves. We must
try to be one of the arbitrary factors in the solution of the
Macedonian question, and therefore we must be armed. We
have no intention of annexing Macedonia, but we wish to
better the positions of our compatriots. It is in the interest
of Turkey to reform Macedonia and to shake off all exterior
influence. When even Roumania arms herself for a few
countrymen, ought we not also to arm? We are only a
small nation, but in order to be safe we ought to have a strong
army. It is said that such an army would be a luxury.
That would be only the case, then, if we could not help ourselves
without assistance. It is our duty to keep an army
ready, for it is only in so doing that we shall be considered of
any consequence when the solution of the Macedonian question
arrives. A weak country is of no importance. Such a country
only serves as a toy for others.</p>

<p class='c001'>“With regard to her culture, agriculture, and her politics,
Bulgaria is to-day in a different condition than heretofore.
Though we do not acknowledge any progress, other countries
see that Bulgaria has made in twenty years a very great progress
and that she still is developing in large strides. We possess
in the Balkan Peninsula a very important point, where many
interests join. The most important, however, is to hope
and to rely on our own strength.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dealing with the foreign policy of Bulgaria, the Prime
Minister said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“They tell us that Bulgaria has no friends. On the
contrary, we possess the friendship of all States. Our relations
with other nations are not at all the same as we found them
in the beginning. No unimportant <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>contretemps</i></span> can disturb
our relations with Russia. I am in the position to proclaim
that Bulgaria possesses the sympathy of all other nations.
The fact that our commercial contract with Austria-Hungary
is not yet signed does not say that our relations with each other
are not friendly. Even the two parties of that country are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>not on good terms, and they cannot decide the contract.
M. Todoroff has said that our relations to Turkey are rather
strained. That is not true: it is the most difficult thing to
enter into any contracts with Turkey. In spite of those
difficulties, we have signed some smaller contracts. It is also
said that Servia has been playing with us, in not showing us
the tariff unions of the Skupshtina. Now, Servia is under
pressure from Austria-Hungary, and at the time that this
proposition was brought before the Skupshtina it could not
be carried by a majority of two votes. That was not sufficient
for us. Servia began to export her goods <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>viâ</i></span> Varna, and up
to to-day no fewer than 4000 waggons of corn have been
exported <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>viâ</i></span> Varna. Is that no success for our railways?</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our relations with our neighbours are formed on a purely
economical basis. We mean to further our industry! But
this economical basis has nothing to do with the great and
pressing Macedonian question. We only wish to keep up
friendly relations with Roumania. We try to keep our relations
with our neighbours in order, and we count upon
success. In which way shall we reach this success? That
surely is our own affair! I have finished. You see that our
policy is a policy of peace. However, remember that peace
can only be protected with arms in the hand, therefore we
wish to enlarge our army. In case we have to incur expenses
for our army, we shall ask them from you without embarrassment.
You may call that bravado on our part, but we shall
still do our duty; for peace to-day means an armed peace.
Led by a policy of peace, we shall try to keep up good relations
with all the nations, and we shall do everything possible to
render assistance to our brethren in Macedonia. We shall
not court war, for that might cost us our liberty. You think
we are ready to draw our swords, you believe we want to
deliver Macedonia through a war? I tell you that we only
want to continue our former policy and walk on with courage.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Prime Minister, with a final wave of his maimed
hand, resumed his seat amid a loud outburst of applause
from both deputies and the general public in the long galleries
of the great white-and-gold Chamber. Only we, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>diplomats’ gallery, were silent—with the Opposition, of
course.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sitting was a historic one in the annals of Bulgaria,
and ere the applause had died away, the President, on the
red-carpeted platform, rang his gong violently, and called
upon the newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs to
make his declaration upon Bulgaria’s future policy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Stancioff, who until recently was Bulgarian diplomatic
agent in St. Petersburg, rose from his seat at the Ministers’
table—a dark, good-looking, middle-aged man—a trifle nervous
perhaps at addressing the Chamber for the first time in his new
position.</p>

<p class='c001'>A dead silence followed. Bulgaria awaited the statement
with breathless eagerness. They had heard the Premier’s
declaration regarding Macedonia. What would the Foreign
Minister say?</p>

<p class='c001'>The blue-uniformed attendants took up their positions
against the dead white panelling of the Chamber, lending the
necessary colour to complete the picturesqueness of the scene,
while the great arc lamps hissed above as they shed their
bright white light over the rows of deputies upon the horseshoe
benches. On the wall, straight before the Ministers’
table, the burnished gold of the holy ikon shone to remind
them of their duty to the Almighty and to the nation. For
a few moments all was silent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Dr. Stancioff, the new man of Bulgaria, cleared his
throat, and in Bulgar made the following clear, deliberate,
and concise statement, of which the following is a translation.
It is, as will be seen, a direct pronunciation of foreign policy—a
firm policy, which may very probably mean war with Turkey
at a no distant date. Indeed, war is in the air in Bulgaria,
and over the Macedonian question may come at any moment;
therefore the Minister’s actual words may, with advantage
to the future, be repeated here.</p>

<p class='c001'>He said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Gentlemen, the Minister President has just given an
ample exposition of the policy the Government has followed
up to the present moment, and the course which it has marked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>out for itself for the future: on this point, therefore, there is
but little left for me to say, as a member of this Government,
and as one who is willing to bear the responsibility of his
acts before this honourable Assembly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Under these circumstances, if I speak, it is chiefly that
my silence may not give rise to misinterpretation, and in
order to underline the words my colleague has said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Without doubt, you remember, gentlemen, that I have
held the post of Foreign Minister only a few days, and I am
under no obligation to enter into any explanation of the
policy followed before my nomination, and on the debates,
interpellations, and the opinions that it has called forth.
Therefore I shall limit myself to saying a few words on the
policy that we are going to follow for the future.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are two questions I wish to discuss. Firstly, our
relations with the Great Powers; and secondly, what is to be
our policy in regard to what I must call the question of questions—Macedonia.</p>

<p class='c001'>“First of all, I am glad to be able to state that our relations
with the Great Powers are of the best.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This fact is always being confirmed by the notifications
which we receive from abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>“By the line of peaceful development which she has
traced for herself, and which she has never ceased to pursue,
by the honourable manner in which she fulfils all her international
engagements, and by the clear comprehension which
she has of her position in the Balkans, Bulgaria is gaining
more and more the sympathy and esteem of the Great Powers.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would be superfluous to mention in detail our relations
with each separate State. Nevertheless, I wish to point out
the happy fact that as to what concerns our relation with
Russia—the Liberating Power—they are what they ought
to be when one considers the ties which bind us to her, when
one considers the ties which unite the two Slav people, and
when one considers all that Bulgaria owes to Russia. Our
relations with Russia are of the best, and it will always be
the Government’s endeavour to render them even more
cordial.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“Economic as well as political considerations bind us
to Austria-Hungary. These interests compel us to maintain
relations as cordial as possible with this Great Power.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our friendship with Germany, England, France, and
Italy is dear to us. We greatly appreciate the sympathy of
which these countries have given us so many proofs, and it
will be our care, guided by the interests of our country, to
consolidate and ameliorate these relations.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As regards our relations with the neighbouring States,
I assert that those with Roumania are, as they ought to be,
the best and the most cordial. We appreciate at its true value
our sincere friendship with Roumania, and it will be our task
to preserve it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our relations with Servia are good. We desire to
cultivate a neighbourly policy with this State. It is a policy
suited to two sister nations, and we shall cultivate it in accordance
with the point of view that Bulgaria has cultivated
for so long. I may add that, to gain this end, we shall do all
that is in our power.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to our relations with Montenegro, it suffices to say
that ancient sympathies, the reciprocity of which has never
been denied, bind us to this State. Our sympathies perpetuate
the nature of these relations with our valiant sister
nation, and assure us that they can only be good and cordial.</p>

<p class='c001'>“From a diplomatic point of view, our relations with
Greece are good and normal; the regrettable incidents which
took place last summer in certain portions of our country
belong to the Department of the Interior. They are, so to
speak, a family matter; they cannot, and must not, be allowed
to darken relations between the two countries, who in their
common interests will guard against a modification so undesirable.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There only remains for me to speak of our relations
with Turkey.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will be brief, though I could speak at great length upon
this subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our relations can only be good, or sincerely good. At
the present moment they are only ‘good.’ Before they can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>become ‘sincerely’ good it is necessary that the two countries
should be convinced not only of the utility of friendly relations,
but also that their interests, political and economic, demand
other relations than those that exist at the moment. As
regards ourselves, who take this matter at its true valuation,
it will be our task to do our utmost to prove to Turkey that
we justly estimate these interests, and are prepared to pursue
a sincere policy, provided that, on her side, she gives us
pledges of her reciprocity.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will be able to estimate what that policy is by the
attitude that we have taken up regarding the Macedonian
question. This is a European question, but that does not
hinder it from being, at the same time, both a Bulgarian and a
Turkish question. First of all, I declare that the Bulgarian
Government is far from having conceived the idea of provoking
or imposing a solution of the Macedonian question by
violent means. But our Government recognises the significance
of this vital question for our country, it justly
estimates the violence with which this question reflects itself
upon the inner life of the Principality, and this renders it
necessary to closely observe its development and its solution.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Macedonian question is in the hands of the Great
Powers, who have taken upon themselves the task of introducing
into Macedonia reforms assuring to the population
of this country a development at once more orderly and more
free. It is true that in this respect up to the present an
altogether satisfactory result has not yet been achieved, and
that the Bulgarian population of Macedonia and the <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayet</i></span>
of Adrianople still have to face complications. But the
Government hopes that the good work they have begun will
make progress. The Government will take every measure
to keep itself currently informed of the situation in Macedonia,
and will do everything in its power to at all times assist the
interested Governments, and insist with all its energy upon
the amelioration of the condition of the people of this country.
The Government think that the representation they are going
to make to the Great Powers in regard to a prompter and
more energetic carrying out of the essential reforms in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Macedonia is not incompatible with having good and cordial
relations with Turkey. On the contrary, they consider that
action of this nature suggests a more normal conception of
the reciprocal interests of the two countries, and that it will
induce the Government of His Majesty the Sultan to adopt
a totally different attitude in regard to the Bulgarian population
of Macedonia—an attitude which will conduce to its
peace, and which will be, at the same time, an important
factor in the destinies of the Empire itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We make no mental reservations with regard to Turkey.
We do not dream of conquest or annexation. But the
Bulgarian nation cannot look coolly on while our blood-brothers
(those of our own blood) are being subjected to
such ordeals as those they are suffering in Turkey. In the
name of reciprocity, in the name of justice and of humanity,
the Bulgarian nation demands that the right of existence, and
that the right of free development in their nationality, and its
religion, be granted to the Bulgarians of Macedonia. She
demands that their right of enjoying the fruits of their labour
be recognised.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Government has the strongest convictions on the
subject of the national duty, and will not waver in carrying
them out. It is the fulfilling of this duty which must constitute
the foundation of friendly relations with Turkey,
and in this matter the Government will stand firm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The arming of our military forces must, of necessity,
be a contradiction. We live in the era of armed peace, and
we must not lose sight of the fact that the peace of Europe
is due, if not entirely, at any rate in great part, to the formidable
armament that each country keeps up. Bulgaria,
though small, cannot evade this essential, if she wishes to
live in peace.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Dr. Stancioff resumed his seat amid thunders of applause.</p>

<p class='c001'>Parliament shortly afterwards adjourned, and we went
home to snatch a hasty dinner and put on our war-paint for
the smart ball at the Military Club.</p>

<p class='c001'>Will Bulgaria declare war against Turkey? That was that
night, and still is, the question on everyone’s lips in Sofia.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER IV <br /> THE BULGARIAN EXARCHATE AND THE PORTE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>A difficult and little-understood problem—Bulgaria the “dark horse” of
the Peninsula—An explanation of the question between Bulgaria and
Turkey—The Bulgarian Church and the Imperial Firman—The present
position of the Exarchate—Europe should listen to the Bulgarian
demand—Chats with Macedonian orphans—Their terrible stories.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question of the Bulgarian Exarchate and the Porte
is of paramount importance in Bulgaria at the present
moment—a very difficult problem which the Government
have to face.</p>

<p class='c001'>So little is it understood in England, even by those professing
to be <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>au courant</i></span> with the Balkan question, that I may perhaps
be pardoned if I endeavour to render the situation intelligible.
“What does Bulgaria want?” is the question so very often
asked. What she really wants, and what are her aims, will, I
hope, be shown in the following pages.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bulgaria, it must always be remembered, is with Servia,
the coming mistress of the Balkans. She is the “dark horse”
of the Peninsula. Her power is admitted, but the extent of
her force cannot be gauged. One thing is certain, that the
present Government being an essentially strong one, and
Dr. Stancioff, the Foreign Minister, a man of action, Bulgaria
will no longer sit still and allow her people in Macedonia to
be decimated as they now are daily.</p>

<p class='c001'>In view of this, therefore, it will perhaps be of interest to
explain impartially at some little length the question which
it is feared must, ere long, bring Turkey and Bulgaria face
to face.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Ever since the liberation of Bulgaria up to the present
moment the Bulgarian Exarchate has led a perturbed
existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>As long ago as the Russo-Turkish War it had to undergo
serious trials, the Exarch being obliged to recall the Bulgarian
bishops from the Macedonian diocese. When, after the
Treaty of Berlin, he attempted to restore them to their former
sees and to complete the organisation of the Bulgarian Church—in
accordance with the Imperial Firman of May 16, 1870—by
establishing a Synod and a Mixed Council, the Exarch received
in 1883 from the Turkish Minister of Justice the following
significant answer:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“When we determine to grant you a status in the <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayets</i></span>,
then only we shall consider the matter of your administration.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So that, after an existence of only three years, the Bulgarian
Exarchate found its right of having a status in the <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayets</i></span>
put in question. This, however, did not discourage the Exarch.
On the contrary, he redoubled his efforts. Relying upon the
Imperial Firman, and assisted by the Bulgarian Government,
he succeeded in winning for the Exarchate an official status
in Macedonia, insisting at the same time on the formation of
a Synod and a Mixed Council, attached to the Exarchate.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the present day the authority of the Exarchate in
Macedonia extends over seven dioceses, namely, Uskub,
Ochrida, Debr, Monastir, Veless, Nevrokop, and Stroumitza.
In addition to these, there are still ten bishoprics which,
contrary to the Firman, remain vacant, because the Sultan
refuses to grant the indispensable <span lang="bg" xml:lang="bg"><i>berats</i></span>. During the period
referred to, the Exarchate was also deprived of its right of
representation at Sketcha and Malgara (<span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayet</i></span> of Adrianople),
whose religious communities were suspended in 1897 by the
Grand Vizier Rifaat Pasha. The Bulgarian chapel at Sketcha
remains to this day under seals placed by the Imperial
authorities, and consequently inaccessible to the spiritual
needs of the Bulgarian population in that place.</p>

<p class='c001'>The question of the Mixed Council and the Synod still
remains open. The solution of this question is of supreme
moment to the Exarchate and to the Bulgarian Government.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>This is due to the position and importance of the religious
communities in the Turkish Empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the better understanding of the bearing of the
issues involved, it will be perhaps necessary to refer to
the history of the Turkish Empire and its attitude towards
Bulgaria.</p>

<p class='c001'>As is well known, instead of trying to assimilate the
Christian nations which they had conquered, the Turks always
considered themselves masters of those whom they had
vanquished. Their system of government in this respect is,
of course, in perfect agreement with the spirit of their religion.
The Koran subdivides all countries into two distinct groups:
first those belonging to Islam, and secondly those under the
domination of the giaours (infidels), with whom Islam was in
a state of permanent war. The true believers, the followers
of the Prophet, were declared rulers of the infidels. These
purely theocratic principles of State organisation form, until
this day, the basis of the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>As exponents of these principles, the Osmanlis did not
attempt, after the conquest of Byzantium, to impose on their
new subjects the Turkish State institutions or civil laws.
Although despised and humiliated, the <span lang="bg" xml:lang="bg"><i>rayas</i></span> continued
to enjoy privileges which, in many respects, remind one of
those subsequently granted by the capitulations to the foreign
Christians. The place of the rulers of the conquered nations
was now occupied by the representatives of their Church.
As an instance, Mohammed <span class='fss'>II.</span>, conqueror of Constantinople,
conferred upon the Patriarch of Constantinople the title of
Miletbashi (Chief of the Nation), and entrusted to him the
administration of the secular and spiritual interests of his
flock. These same prerogatives were also granted to the
Bulgarian Patriarchs of Tirnovo and Ochrida, as representatives
of the Bulgarian nation. The spiritual leaders of the conquered
races delegated, in their turn, part of their attributes
to their inferiors—bishops and priests.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Bulgarian Military Types.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In this way, the clergy formed a body of functionaries
invested with large administrative and judicial powers. Every
religious community was entrusted with the repartition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the State taxes among the members of the community, and
was responsible for their payment into the State Exchequer.
In a word, the spiritual head of a Christian race was at the
same time its civil representative before the Turkish authorities.
As regards the Bulgarian nation, this mission was confided,
down to the year 1770, to its Patriarchs—at first, to the
Patriarchs of Tirnovo and Ochrida, and, later on, to that
of the latter place—until the abolition of the Patriarchate of
Ochrida, which was brought about by the intrigues of the
Greeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact remains that during several centuries the Christians
in the Turkish Empire—and among them the Bulgarians—have,
owing to this peculiarity of the Turkish State policy,
enjoyed a relative independence, and in this way have been
able to preserve their nationality, language, and customs.
These exceptional historical circumstances explain at the
same time why, among these Christians, the sentiment of
patriotism has been transformed into an attachment to
their religious communities and their national Church.</p>

<p class='c001'>This sentiment of patriotism and spiritual consciousness,
which, owing to the oppression exercised by the Greek clergy,
after the year 1770 had weakened to the extent of national
self-forgetfulness and identification with the Greeks, awakened
once more among the Bulgarians during the second half of
last century. It acquired great force in the course of the
struggle for the restoration of the ancient national Church.
This new struggle began at the time of the Tanzimat, a period
when the Porte had to fight against the growing omnipotence
of the Patriarchate, which was threatening the very foundations
of the State. It had, as its legal support, the Hatti-Houmayoun
of 1856, which reverted to the historical rights of
all religious communities. The second part of Section II.
of this Act runs as follows:—</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Chaque communauté Chrétienne ou d’autre rite non-musulman
sera tenue, dans un délai fixé et avec le concours d’une
commission formée <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad hoc</i></span> dans son sein, de procéder, avec
ma haute approbation et sous la surveillance de ma Sublime
Porte, à l’examen de ses immunités et privilèges et d’y discuter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>et soumettre à ma Sublime Porte les réformes exigées par
le progrès des lumières et du temps.”</span></p>

<p class='c001'>Progress, as well as the State interests of the Empire at
that time, required the administrative separation of the
Bulgarian Church from the Patriarchate, and its endowment
with a special chief and clergy. It is interesting to note
that, in this struggle of the Sublime Porte with the Patriarchate
for the denationalisation of the Christian communities—which
had for its consequence the weakening of the Patriarchate
and the restriction of its privileges—the Bulgarian nation
acted as allies of the Empire, with “the high approval of
the Sultan” and “under the control of the Sublime Porte.”
Thanks mainly to this alliance and to this struggle against
the Patriarchate in favour of the Bulgarian nation, the
Patriarchate was considerably weakened through the Organic
Statute of 1862, while the Bulgarian Church was restored in
virtue of the Firman of 1870.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the Bulgarian Church restored, it was necessary, in
accordance with the Imperial Firman, that it should be
organised after the pattern of the Eastern Orthodox Church,
of which it formed a branch, without in any case departing
from its canons. The Exarchate, as its highest administrative
body, was organised on such close lines with the Patriarchate,
that its Organic Statute is, in greater part, nothing but a
reproduction of that of the Patriarchate in 1862, which, in
its turn, is based on the principles laid down by the Hatti-Houmayoun.</p>

<img src='images/i_210fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Peasants near Tirnovo, Bulgaria.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In view of all this, it must be admitted that to-day the
struggle—or rather the insistence of the Exarchate for the
speedier organisation of a Synod and a Mixed Council, forming
part of itself—is only a just and legal claim of the rights and
privileges sanctioned by the Firman of 1870. It should be
clearly understood that the Bulgarian Exarchate does not
ask for any new privileges; all that it demands is the restoration
of the Synod and the Mixed Council as they existed before
the Russo-Turkish War. Surely this is but a very natural
demand! The question concerns two administrative bodies,
with attributes strictly defined by the canons of the Church,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>as well as by the statute of the Exarchate and the Imperial
Firman, and which cannot be delegated to anyone else, but
must be exercised by the Synod and the Mixed Council. To
the Synod are reserved all questions of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>forum ecclesiasticum</i></span>,
while the mission of the Mixed Council is to look after the
schools, the civil administration, and the organisation of the
Bulgarian nationality. The Mixed Council forms at the same
time the highest judicial body in civil cases between Bulgarians—the
mixed courts being reserved for civil cases between Mohammedans
and Christians, as well as for commercial and criminal
cases without any distinction of religion. This brief mention
of the attributes of the Synod and of the Mixed Council is
surely sufficient to show the very urgent need of their speedy
restoration and organisation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The needs of the Church and of the community have
greatly increased; they are no longer what they used to be
thirty years ago, and cannot be left disregarded. The requirements
of the population and of the times give rise to
fresh questions, while on the other hand the Imperial Ottoman
Government comes every day with fresh demands to
the Exarchate, which shares in the administration of the
country, as an auxiliary organ.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these present-day times of trial the Bulgarian population
in Macedonia, broken up, persecuted, and outlawed as
it is, turns for help and protection to its legal head and protector,
the Exarch. The Exarch is, however, helpless, because
personally he has no authority to decide such questions as
fall within the competence of the Mixed Council. His only
rôle in such matters is to act as an intermediary between the
Council and the Sublime Porte.</p>

<p class='c001'>The present position of the Exarchate is an abnormal
one. According to the Firman, which has the force of law
within the Empire, it has well-defined rights and obligations
as regards the Porte and the Bulgarian nation in the <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayets</i></span>,
which, however, it cannot exercise or fulfil because of its
imperfect and irregular organisation. This state of things
provokes among the populations of the Empire complaints
both against the Exarchate and the Imperial authorities.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Failing to find help and protection at the hands of the legal
authorities, the outraged population is naturally tempted
to look for such in illegal quarters, and in its despair places
its hopes in foreign intervention. This state of affairs explains
and fully justifies such tendencies among the Macedonian
population. The true interests of the Ottoman Empire
demand the preservation of its Christian inhabitants from
similar hopes and tendencies. The population ought to
expect all improvements from Constantinople. In this
respect the formation of a Synod and of a Mixed Council
attached to the Exarchate is not only a just demand, admitted
on every hand outside Turkey, but is highly desirable and
indispensable for the pacification of public opinion both in
the <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayets</i></span> and in Bulgaria. By their very constitution,
this Synod and the Mixed Council would act as legal interpreters
of the needs of the Bulgarian population in Macedonia
and the <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayet</i></span> of Adrianople, and would form a strong link
between the Bulgarians and the Sublime Porte.</p>

<p class='c001'>It would surely be preferable both for the Powers and for
Turkey if they had to deal with a legally organised and
responsible body, such as the Bulgarian Exarchate. Indeed,
this latter, if completed and fortified by the creation of the
Synod and the Mixed Council, would no doubt succeed in
attracting the attention of the Bulgarian population of the
<i>vilayets</i> once more to Constantinople. The cause of the
Macedonian reforms would benefit considerably from such
an organisation, while the difficult task of the Powers would
be greatly facilitated.</p>

<p class='c001'>The just and legal measure I have outlined above would
pacify public opinion in the Principality of Bulgaria. That
something must be done is very plain. Matters in Macedonia
cannot be allowed to remain as they are—a blot upon the
civilisation of Europe. Bulgaria is, as far as I have been
able to judge from personal inquiry, determined to take a
strong and definite line. She cannot remain indifferent to
the injustice of the Porte towards the Bulgarian Exarchate;
neither can she overlook the burning question. Even if she
were inclined to adopt such a course, she would not be in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>position to do so. No Bulgarian Government could follow
such a policy without being accused of violating the Constitution,
according to which the Eastern Orthodox religion
is the State religion of the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>In ecclesiastical matters the Principality is, according to
Article 39 of the Bulgarian Constitution, placed under the
control of the highest spiritual authority of the Bulgarian
Church, wherever that authority may be found. This
authority is the Bulgarian Exarchate. It must be remembered,
too, that this Constitution was ratified at the time,
by the Powers signatory of the Treaty of Berlin. The right of
the Principality to take an interest in the normal and regular
working of the authority in question now became even more
indisputable. Besides, political considerations of the very
highest importance to the peace of Europe place upon the
Bulgarian Government the duty of reminding the Great
Powers, Turkey included, of the liabilities which they
assumed towards the Christian population of the vilayets
by virtue of Articles 25 and 62 of the Treaty of Berlin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Only natural is it, and in the cause of humanity, that
Bulgaria should seek to protect the Bulgarians in Macedonia.
Never has the country been in a worse state than at the present
time, and never has European interference been more needed
than at this moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Europe should listen attentively to this Bulgarian complaint
against Turkey, for it is surely a just one, crying loudly
for remedy. The blood of the poor massacred thousands in
Macedonia calls to-day to the Powers for mercy and justice,
and yet to-morrow, and still to-morrow, a hundred more
defenceless men and women and innocent children are put
to the sword, mutilated and murdered, and we in England hear
nothing about it. Macedonia is, alas! a country where God
is high and Justice far away.</p>

<p class='c001'>This question of the Bulgarian Exarchate and the Porte
is, I know, an abstruse one, neglected by most writers on the
subject. However, it is one of the highest importance—one
which is inseparable from the future policy of Bulgaria.</p>

<p class='c001'>Things cannot remain long in Macedonia as I myself saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>them. Europe holds up her hands in virtuous horror at the
so-called Congo scandals and seeks out every detail of maladministration,
yet she turns a deaf ear to the piteous cry of
the Macedonians, whose homes are daily burned and pillaged,
and whose villages are often completely wiped out—both
dwellings and inhabitants—in the course of a few hours by
fiends filled with the lust of blood.</p>

<p class='c001'>If you doubt that there are horrible atrocities daily committed
in Macedonia by Greeks and Turks alike, you need go
no farther than Sofia. Visit the Orphanage for Macedonian
boys established three years ago by Mr. Pierce O’Mahony,
an Irish philanthropist, of Grange Con, County Wicklow.
This gentleman was living in Sofia, and hearing terrible stories
of massacres across the frontier, established an institution for
the education of orphans whose parents had been killed in
the raids. When I visited the place, I found it neat, orderly,
and doing a most charitable and excellent work under the
care of two English nursing sisters. In a large commodious
house on the outskirts of the capital were thirty lads ranging
in age from seven to fifteen, all dressed in their white woollen
and black-braided national costume of Macedonia.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the boys were assembled in the large classroom,
I heard some of their stories, and truly they were appalling,
many of the details too terrible to be placed here on record.
As an instance, one lad I saw, a bright, intelligent little fellow,
was admitted to the Orphanage a few months ago. He lived
in the district of Ochrida, and was one day tending his sheep
as usual, when some Turkish soldiers came past.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you seen a Bulgarian band pass along just now?”
they inquired.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lad declared that he had seen nobody. The soldiers
doubted him, for the Bulgarian band in question was protecting
the villages in that neighbourhood.</p>

<div id='i214'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_214fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Tziganes on the Isker road.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>They asked again, and the boy denied having seen anybody,
which was the truth. Whereupon one of the Sultan’s
soldiers smashed the little fellow’s skull in with the butt end
of his rifle, while another took a knife and cut his throat from
ear to ear. They then dug a rough hole in the ground and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>buried him. Some hours after, a shepherd passing noticed
that his dog was scratching the earth, and on going to the
spot, heard moans. The lad was quickly exhumed, and found
to be still living. For many weeks he was in the hospital in
Salonica, but was eventually admitted to Mr. O’Mahony’s
Home. When I saw him, the wound in the head had only
just healed, and the ugly scar across the throat was still red.
I have his photograph, but it is too ghastly to here reproduce.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another little lad described to me how his father and
mother had been tortured by the Turks and afterwards burnt
alive before his eyes, while another related how he had been
captured by the Turks, taken into slavery, and afterwards
escaped.</p>

<p class='c001'>Each orphan boy had his own terrible story to tell, stories
that were full of horror and inhuman butchery, stories that
made one wonder whether such things could really happen
in this enlightened century.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to the institute and its general conduct, there is no
doubt it is performing a most humane and charitable work.
There are thousands of the homeless and fatherless in Macedonia,
increasing thousands, and the institute, which is purely a
piece of private philanthropy, cannot possibly admit one-tenth
of the applicants for its charity. The founder hopes, if
private subscribers or donors come forward, to extend his
work, and Lady Buchanan of the British Legation, Sofia,
who takes a great interest in it, told me that she would
be very pleased to acknowledge any subscriptions sent to her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Certainly it is most deserving of support, for already it
has sent Macedonian lads into the Bulgarian Agricultural
School at Kustendil; two others are in the Cadet School in
Sofia, and will become officers; others have been taught
trades and are earning their living; and one has been sent
to England. Though the founder is a member of the Church
of England, the lads are allowed to retain their own religion,
the Orthodox.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every right-minded man must, after investigating the
complaint of Bulgaria against the Porte regarding the Exarchate,
take the part of Bulgaria. Macedonia is to-day and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>every day being decimated by Greek bands who raid under
the protection and with the connivance of the Turks, and
assuredly Bulgaria has just cause for reprisals. At present,
however, her bands are inactive, and she is endeavouring to
adjust the difficulty by diplomatic channels. Bulgaria has
no desire for war, neither has Turkey.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the question must ere long be faced boldly and fearlessly,
and a solution arrived at. Bulgaria has right on her
side, and in the name of humanity it is the duty of the Powers
to support her.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER V <br /> AT A ROSE DISTILLERY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Tobacco growing in Bulgaria—The otto-of-rose industry—About adulteration—Difficulties
of obtaining the pure extract—Corrupting the peasant—What
Monsieur Shipkoff told me—Some tests to discover adulteration—Interesting
facts about roses.</p>

<p class='c001'>NO description of the present condition of Bulgaria would
be complete without mention of the two principal
industrial plants cultivated in the country—tobacco and
roses.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tobacco, I noticed, was particularly plentiful in the
south and in the departments of Silistra and Kustendil.
The department of Haskovo, it appears, produces 800,000
kilos of first quality tobacco, followed by Philippopoli with
300,000 kilos, Kustendil with 270,000 kilos, and Silistra with
210,000. Three-quarters of all this tobacco is consumed in
the country, for Bulgarians are inveterate cigarette-smokers,
and the remaining quarter exported. Tobacco in leaf is
sold at an average price of 80 centimes to 1 fr. 50 c. per kilogramme.
The Government give the peasants, in order to
encourage tobacco cultivation, quantities of seed gratis.</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards the cultivation of roses, the special species
grown are the red rose (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Rosa damascena</i></span>) and various species
of white rose, of which the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Rosa moscata</i></span> is the most used,
the best and most extensive plantations being at Kazanlik,
Karlovo, Klissoura, and Stara-Sagora.</p>

<p class='c001'>I was afforded an opportunity of visiting one of the otto-of-rose
distilleries, and the sweet, penetrating perfume of it
clings still to the nostrils. Bulgarian otto-of-rose is famous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>the world over, and its production is carried on in 175 communes
in the departments of Philippopoli and Stara-Sagora.</p>

<p class='c001'>The chief manufacturers and exporters of otto-of-rose
are Messrs. Shipkoff &amp; Co. of Kazanlik, who export about
two-thirds of the whole rose produce. This firm, as well
as the others, make advances to the peasantry upon their
growing crops of roses, and the peasant pays these advances
in otto-of-rose already distilled. The firms make it a part
of the contract that the extract must be pure, and can refuse
to accept it if adulterated. As a check, all the exporters
make it a point to themselves distil in the various rose-growing
districts for the purpose of obtaining the proper standard of
purity.</p>

<p class='c001'>I had an opportunity of visiting Mr. Theodore Shipkoff,
Deputy for Kazanlik, of the great firm of Shipkoff &amp; Co.
He showed me over the factory, and gave me a number of
extremely interesting details regarding this unique industry.</p>

<p class='c001'>It appears that nowadays it is not an easy matter to
obtain pure otto-of-rose. Some forty years ago the entire
rose industry was an ideal one. No farmers, small or big,
adulterated their otto. They knew nothing about adulteration.
In their primitive simplicity and honesty, it would
have been altogether against their nature to falsify in any
way their produce. The jobbers and dealers who used to
come from Adrianople and Constantinople to buy it, and
who at that time controlled the whole exportation, while
buying it from the growers in its pure state, soon began to
adulterate it with the Turkish geranium oil (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Idris Yaghi</i></span>).
They found this way of adulterating the otto-of-rose so profitable
that, in order to use a larger percentage of geranium
oil and at the same time to render it less easily detected, they
began to import from Constantinople the crude geranium
oil, and in the presence of the growers to redistil and refine
it in rose-flowers and rose-water, thus taking away its pungent
and heavy vegetable odour. Some of the growers soon learned
to do this themselves, and the peddling traders started regular
factories for the express purpose of refining geranium oil
and selling it afterwards to the peasants for purposes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>adulteration. In this way many villages were gradually
corrupted, and the otto-of-rose they produced was more
or less adulterated with geranium oil; but most of the
adulteration has always been done by the exporting jobbers
and dealers. This, of course, brought much discredit to
the rose industry, and the Government, some fifteen years
ago, was compelled to prohibit the importation of geranium
oil into the country. This measure was a most wholesome
one, and checked, to some extent, the free and open importation
of geranium, and saved many of the rose villages from
further corruption. However, a great deal of geranium oil
is still imported <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sub rosâ</i></span> into Bulgaria by unscrupulous
jobbers and exporters, and much of the otto-of-rose sold is
largely adulterated with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Shipkoff, in course of his conversation with me when
he showed me over his distillery at Kazanlik, said, “As our
principle is to export only the genuine otto-of-rose, and sell
only what we can guarantee as absolutely pure, our task has
been, and is, a most difficult one. With the primitive system
of distillation still in use in our country, it is actually impossible
for us to distil all the otto-of-rose we export, and we still have
to depend on our growers for the greater part of our stock.
When the means of transportation and communication improve,
it will then be possible to centralise the whole distillation
in a few places, and establish large steam distilleries,
such as those in Grasse, Cannes, and Leipzig. At present
most of the rose-flowers are distilled in the villages where they
are grown, and by the growers themselves, this method being
by far the cheapest. Still, to guard ourselves from all possible
adulteration on the part of our suppliers, and at the same
time to be able to get as much otto-of-rose as possible of our
own distillation, we ourselves have to distil in all the principal
places in the eight rose counties of the rose district, and each
year we increase our own distillations.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is by virtue of this extensive distillation that we are
able to obtain pure otto. Besides this practical means, we
have continually experimented to discover various tests,
whereby we can readily distinguish the pure from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>adulterated rose. It is quite impossible simply from the
sense of smell to always recognise an adulteration from two
to five per cent., and the following are the tests, which we
possess and use in conducting our business: the freezing-point
test, the specific gravity test, the density test, the
spectrum test, the iodine test, and the nitric acid test.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Otto-of-rose, when analysed, is found to consist of two
ingredients: the oleoptene, which is the liquid and odoriferous
part of the otto-of-rose, and the stereoptene, which
is the solid and odourless part, and causes the crystallisation
of the otto-of-rose. The proportion in which these two
ingredients are combined in the pure otto-of-rose is more
or less fixed, varying only from 10 to 15 per cent. according
to the elevation of the localities in which the otto is produced.
The highest proportion—15 per cent.—is found in otto-of-rose
distilled in villages situated highest in the Balkans;
while the villages down in the plains produce otto-of-rose
containing only 10 to 11 per cent. of stereoptene. We
have lately made experiments to distil these two ingredients
separately, but they can best be separated from each other
by a very simple physical process. The average proportion
of these two ingredients in our stocks during the last five
years has been about 12½ per cent. of stereoptene and 87½ per
cent. of oleoptene.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The oil usually employed for the adulteration of otto-of-rose
is the geranium oil (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i><a id='corr220.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic: Pelargonium radula'>Palagonium Radula</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_220.26'><ins class='correction' title='sic: Pelargonium radula'>Palagonium Radula</ins></a></span></i></span>) known to the
trade as Turkish geranium oil. This oil is made in India
and is sold in Constantinople. Formerly they used this oil
as adulterant in its crude state, but now it is generally refined
in rose-water or rose-flower before it is used. No matter how
well refined, it is impossible to put 5 per cent. of it in otto-of-rose
without changing the freezing point of the otto, its
specific gravity, and the proportion in which the stereoptene
and oleoptene are combined. Geranium oil contains no
stereoptene, and in consequence does not crystallise. In the
best refined geranium oil the specific gravity is fully ·880—a
difference in weight of about eighteen points. All this
helps to detect its presence in otto-of-rose. It can also be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>detected by means of the iodine as well as the nitric acid
tests. The presence of geranium oil in otto-of-rose lowers
its freezing point, renders its specific gravity heavier, and
changes the proportion in which the oleoptene and stereoptene
are combined.</p>

<p>The Rose-fields near Kazanlik.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>“In order to rectify these defects, the use of spermaceti,
paraffin, and alcohol have often been resorted to, but the
presence of all these three substances can be discovered without
any difficulty. The crystals of both spermaceti and paraffin
are entirely different from the crystals of the stereoptene of
otto-of-rose, and otto-of-rose containing any proportion of
either will lose, when congealed, its sharp-pointed, needle-like
crystals. Besides, paraffin and spermaceti being fatty oils,
are much heavier, and in time will settle at the bottom.
Furthermore, they are not volatile as stereoptene. The
presence of alcohol is detected either by the use of double
distilled water or of pure glycerine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>By resorting to these various tests in the selection of
supplies from growers, as well as by extensive distillation in
all the principal localities, respectable firms are always able
to procure the finest otto-of-rose and to export it in its absolute
purity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole rose district comprises in all 173 villages, devoted
to rose culture, with about 15,500 acres of rose plantations.
These yield annually from 20,000,000 to 25,000,000 pounds of
rose-flowers, for the distillation of which some 13,000 native
stills are used. The total yield of otto annually varies according
to the year—from 90,000 to 150,000 ounces; the average crop
being about 120,000 ounces of pure otto-of-rose. It generally
takes from 160 to 250 pounds rose-flowers to make one ounce
of otto—and there are about 300 roses to the pound.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nearly all the otto produced in Bulgaria is exported for
consumption abroad, and chiefly to New York, Paris, and
London, its three largest markets, and from there it is distributed
all over the world. Formerly the perfumers used
to be supplied through the intermediary of Constantinople,
Leipzig, and London, but now all large consumers buy their
supply direct. The house of Shipkoff was the first to inaugurate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>this system of direct relations. It saves many extra charges,
and in case of the goods delivered turning out badly, the
guilty party is at once detected.</p>

<p class='c001'>Shipkoffs do not believe in all sorts of grades, their motto
being, “<em>Only one quality—the best.</em>”</p>

<p class='c001'>The culture of roses in Bulgaria is not only the oldest
and most attractive industry of the country, but also quite
exclusively its own. While roses are found all over the world
and are grown everywhere in garden-beds, in Bulgaria they
are grown in extensive fields, as we grow the potato
or corn. This industry, however, is confined only to one
special district in Bulgaria, which is comprised in the eight
counties above mentioned, with Kazanlik as their central
town, called, in consequence, the capital of the rose district.
The rose district extends along that portion of the southern
slopes of the Balkan mountains, comprising in itself the
branch range of the Little Balkans, which shoots out of the
main Balkans and forms one of its chief arms. The average
length of the rose district is about eighty miles, and its average
width is about thirty miles. Its average elevation is about
1300 feet above the level of the sea. The average height of
the Balkans along the rose district is about 5600 feet, while
that of the Little Balkans is about 3700 feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>Attempts have often been made to grow roses all over
Bulgaria, but they have all proved a failure. It is true that
roses have been grown, and are grown to this day, in Persia,
India, Egypt, and China for this purpose, but they hardly
produce any otto-of-rose. They produce almost exclusively
rose-water, and it is chiefly used for local consumption. In the
Maritime Alps of Southern France, and especially in Cannes
and Grasse, they grow quite extensively the “Provence rose,”
and they extract from it a peculiar otto-of-rose, but the quantity
is very limited, and they chiefly use their flowers to make
pomades and rose-water. In Leipzig they also grow roses,
but with very little success. Almost in all the other places
where the roses are grown, they lack the peculiar advantages
of climate that Bulgaria possesses, and have in consequence
to use twice and even thrice the quantity of flowers to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>make the same amount of otto. The hottest weather ever
experienced in summer in this part of Bulgaria is 88° Fahr.
and the coldest of winter is rarely under 15° Fahr. above zero.
Then, during the harvest and distillation season, which is in
the latter part of May and the first part of June, there we
have regular showers of rain and in the mornings heavy falls of
dew—both absolutely necessary for the otto-of-rose distillation.</p>

<p class='c001'>After the Russo-Turkish War in 1877-78, when Bulgaria
was separated from Turkey and constituted into an independent
Principality, the Turkish Government spent thousands
of pounds in trying to replant the Kazanlik rose in Asia Minor,
and many scores of rose-gardens were planted around Broussa,
but to no purpose. The gardens grew, thrived, and yielded
plenty of flowers, but when distilled they got only rose-water
and very little otto, so the work, in consequence, could not
pay. It is the peculiarity of the soil, and chiefly that of the
atmosphere of this special district in Bulgaria, caused by
the peculiar formation of the mountain ranges surrounding
it, which makes the roses thrive and yield sufficient otto-of-rose
to pay for the very laborious work that the culture entails.</p>

<p class='c001'>The red rose grown is a semi-double light red rose like
the French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rose du roi</i></span>, having from thirty to thirty-six petals
and possessing an extremely rich and fragrant odour. The
growing of the rose is very much like the growth of the vine,
and the planting of a rose-garden is similar to that of a vineyard.
After the ground has been prepared by tilling and
manuring, ditches are made in rows, about a foot and a half
in depth and width, and a yard and a half apart. At the
bottom of these ditches soft earth mixed with manure is spread,
on which the roots forming the bushes of the new rose-garden
and taken from old bushes are firmly stuck vertically, and
then well covered up with the earth and manure. This is
generally done in the spring, when the rain showers abound.
The roses thus planted soon take root, and in less than two
months send up soft, glossy green shoots, which in a year
become about a foot high. In the second year they are over
two feet high, and yield a few rose-flowers. The first crop
worth gathering is in the third year, and in the fifth year they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>attain their full growth. They reach then a height of about
six feet, the bushes forming thick rows of clustered rose-trees
and continuing to yield rich crops of flowers for a period of
twenty years, and in some localities twenty-five years, after
the lapse of which time they become old, begin to die from
the winter’s cold and frost, and yield but few flowers. Then
the old rose-bushes are dug out and the garden is planted
anew.</p>

<p class='c001'>A rose-garden requires constant care. During the year
it is hoed three times. In autumn the roots are covered up
with earth to guard them from the winter’s cold. In spring
that earth is thrown off and the bushes are pruned, and every
other year the garden is manured.</p>

<p class='c001'>The roses yield only one crop every year. The rose-harvest
begins in the latter part of May, and as the weather is dry
and hot or cool and rainy during the blossoming season, it
may last from eighteen to thirty days. During the whole
harvest the distillation of the crop is carried on. Morning
after morning, hours before sunrise, groups of young maidens
and boys, all dressed in their beautiful bright-coloured native
costumes, proceed with songs to the rose-gardens to gather
the newly opened buds while the heavy morning dew is still
on the blossoms. Nothing can present a more captivating
scene than a rose-garden in bloom, with its gaily attired peasant-girls
gathering the roses, and its nightingales—those romantic
lovers of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Regina florum</i></span>—trying in most melodious songs
to out-sing the maidens.</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as the roses are gathered they are taken to the
distillery, spread in cool and shady rooms, and gradually
distilled during the day. The alembics used for this purpose
are of the simplest kind. They consist of a convex tinned
copper boiler, narrowed at the top to a neck on which is fixed
a spherical head-piece with a tube on one side, to which is
attached the condensing tube, sloping down and passing
through the condenser or refrigerator, a large vessel into
which cold water is constantly running. The capacity of
the boiler is about 250 pounds of water. In distilling the
roses from twenty to twenty-five pounds of flowers are put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>in it, and from five to six times that much of water, thus
nearly filling three-fourths of the boiler.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This done, the head-piece and condensing tube are tightly
attached, the fire started, and the distilling of its contents
begun. This is carried on about forty-five minutes, until
thirty to thirty-five pounds of rose-water are extracted from
each boiler. The boilers are then emptied, cleansed with
clear water, and the same process is repeated until all the
morning-gathered flowers are distilled. The rose-water extracted
from the first distillation is redistilled in the same
way, only in this second distillation from 100 to 120 pounds
of rose-water are used, and out of it they extract some thirty
to thirty-five pounds of second rose-water. This double-distilled
rose-water is very strong in odour and quite turbid
in appearance; it is full of tiny yellow-white oily globules
floating in it, and as the bottle is filled they rise up and gather
on the top of the long-necked bottles in which the rose-water
runs. These globules are the otto-of-rose, and when all the
oil has settled on the tops of the bottles, it is skimmed and
put in separate bottles by little conical spoons, with a little
hole in the bottom, large enough to let the water run out but
not the oil.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus collected, the otto is sent to London, Paris, and New
York, where it is used in the manufacture of high-class perfumes
and soaps, etc.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER VI <br /> THE FUTURE OF BULGARIA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Bulgaria’s future greatness—Her firm policy in Macedonia—An audience
of Dr. Stancioff, Minister of Foreign Affairs—A chat with the Prime
Minister—Turkey the enemy of Bulgaria—Balkan “news” in the
London papers—How it is manufactured—Turkish dominion doomed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The future of Bulgaria is assured.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bulgaria, with Servia, is destined to become the power
in the Balkans. Vigorous, strong, and fearless, under a Prince
who has the courage of his own convictions, the country is
one of progress, of great military strength and continual
expansion. The Bulgar differs from the Roumanian inasmuch
as he is more patriotic and far less extravagant; he is
frugal, progressive, and active. His capital is not the weak
imitation of Paris, as is Bucharest, nor are his officers gorgeously
dressed and corseted. On the contrary, they are hardy, well
trained, well equipped, and business-like to a degree.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some interesting sidelights upon Bulgaria’s growing
military strength have been revealed at the recent man&oelig;uvres,
while an afternoon walk through Sofia will show how rapidly
and firmly is the capital being established—the capital which
is destined some day to be the capital of the Balkans.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Bulgarian Peasants dancing the “horo.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>On every hand I saw evidence of Bulgaria’s future
greatness. The Ministry, without exception, is a strong one
and incorruptible. There is a firmness and stability about
everything, all betokening a great future. Ministerial
crises are few, and the people do not neglect their affairs
for politics, as is the case in some Balkan countries. Under
Prince Ferdinand Bulgaria has progressed amazingly, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>in the near future will assume a position of supreme importance
in the Peninsula. Her policy towards Roumania is,
however, a somewhat undecided one. While the Roumanians
fondly think that Bulgaria cannot take decisive action in
Macedonia without her consent, Bulgaria seems to calmly
ignore Roumania’s existence. I have reason for believing
that some satisfactory agreement will be arrived at in the
course of the next month or two. Bulgaria, however, is
wide awake and well aware that Roumania is desirous of
a slice of her territory from the Danube down to the Black
Sea. Only to obtain this would Roumania be party to any
alliance regarding Macedonia.</p>

<p class='c001'>One morning at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Sofia
I had audience with the newly appointed Minister, His Excellency
Dr. Dimitri Stancioff. He is the coming man of Bulgaria,
at one time private secretary to the Prince, and afterwards,
as already explained, diplomatic agent in St. Petersburg, where
he had an extremely brilliant career.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of middle height, slim of figure, with dark hair slightly
silvered, a keen, rather aquiline face, and sharp eyes, he is a
man full of eager activity, quick perception, and indomitable
energy.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had only been in office a few days, and was overwhelmed
with work, yet he spared me half an hour for a chat, although
certain chiefs of the foreign missions were waiting for audience.
In his quiet, sombre, business-like cabinet, he sat behind his
littered table, smiling affably and ready to answer any questions
I put to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You want to see Bulgaria? Very well, I will give orders
that you have good guides, and that you are supplied with all
the official information available. Only,” he laughed, “please
do not flatter us. We prefer honest criticism.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He took down a list of the heads of the information I
wanted, gave me a cigarette, and then we discussed the future
of Bulgaria.</p>

<p class='c001'>“His Royal Highness the Prince has told me that he sent
you an autographed portrait last night. Have you received
<a id='corr226.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='t'>it</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_226.38'><ins class='correction' title='t'>it</ins></a></span>?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>I replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will see you in Varna,” he went on. “His Highness
particularly wishes to see you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then I asked him to explain Bulgaria’s future policy in
the Balkans.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You heard my speech in the Sobranje. Well, that
constitutes in brief the future policy of Bulgaria—peace. We
are a young nation, and we do not desire any complications
with our neighbours. You have seen Sofia. You have seen
how in the past ten years it has risen. Yet there still remains
very much to do. The city is in a state of construction, and
so it is all through the country. All we desire is to be allowed
peace, in order to develop our resources.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And your relations with Turkey?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! those constant incidents in Macedonia are of course
regrettable. The question is always with us. Yet since
I assumed office I have received reports from our diplomatic
agent in Constantinople which clearly show that Turkey
has assumed a much more conciliatory attitude. We are
hoping for the best. Our relations with Turkey are still
friendly, and the friendship is becoming daily more firmly
cemented. What we wish, however, to see is greater interest
taken by the Powers in the Macedonian question. Neither
Bulgaria nor Servia nor Roumania can solve the great
problem—only joint action by the Powers. We hope that,
ere long, an international council may be held to discuss and
decide the question once and for all. The present state of
affairs is intolerable. But you will see for yourself when
you get into Macedonia.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And assuredly, two months later, I did see—things that
are incredible in Europe in this twentieth century.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I also had a pleasant chat with Monsieur D. Petkoff, the
Prime Minister. We sat next each other at dinner one night
at Sir George Buchanan’s, and I learnt that he had been responsible
for the destruction of old Sofia, and the laying out of
the new city. For six years of the reconstruction he had been
Mayor of the capital, and, as I afterwards learnt, to his efforts
the great progress had been due. Sofia may well be called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Petkoffopolis. At any rate, it is hoped that one of the streets
will be named after him. He struck me as an earnest, thoughtful
man, the born leader of a party. Rather short of stature,
dark-haired, with a small imperial just turning grey, his
countenance was strong, open, and very pleasant. He spoke
deliberately, with an air of conviction, and his conversation
with me, which was of a private nature, was that of a man
who believed in the future of his country and was an advocate
of peace and progress.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Austria is Servia’s sworn enemy, so is Turkey the
enemy of Bulgaria. War would have been declared by
Turkey against Bulgaria long ago, were it not for the personal
veto of the Sultan, who is not only contrary to hostilities with
his near neighbour, but views Bulgaria with increasing
favour. His Majesty has, if the real truth be told, accurately
gauged his neighbour’s military strength. The war party
in Turkey have long been eager for an attack upon Bulgaria,
but the Sultan is a far-seeing monarch, and no one knows
better than he that Bulgaria is very strong in a military
sense, and is a power to be reckoned with if ever the Macedonian
question is solved by force of arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>At present it is the Greeks who, by their unwarrantable
attacks upon the Macedonian villages, are attempting to
incite and provoke Bulgaria. Here is an instance. Not
long ago the Bulgarian police received secret information,
and searched the house of the Greek Bishop of Philippopolis,
where they found many incriminating documents showing
plainly that the Greek Church was actually collecting funds
for armed raids upon the Bulgarians in Macedonia. Letters
were found addressed to the various Greek priests giving
the orders as to how they should act. These somehow got
into the papers, whereupon a serious riot occurred in Philippopolis,
and the Bulgarian soldiery were sent to quell it. Bulgaria’s
enemies, mostly subsidised Press correspondents,
declared that the riot against the Greeks was provoked by
the Government itself, and such statements were published
broadcast in the Press of Europe. These allegations, however,
had absolutely no foundation, for the rising was purely a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>local one, prompted by the knowledge that the Bishop
was fostering a conspiracy against their brothers in Macedonia.
If ever the Bulgarian public was provoked to reprisals,
it was on that historic day, and the Government’s action was
perfectly justified in interfering, otherwise the demonstration
against the Greeks would have spread all over the country,
with very serious result.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our English arm-chair critics—those who do not travel
and see the country for themselves—do not understand the
Balkans. They form their opinions from the incorrect and
misleading statements made by journalists and by journals
subsidised by the enemy. Some of the statements are so
absurd as to be amusing, for they are utterly devoid of the
slightest foundation of fact. Indeed, they are often mere
tissues of plausible falsehoods.</p>

<p class='c001'>While in the Balkans I read extraordinary accounts in the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Zeit</i></span> of things that, to my own personal knowledge, never
happened. Each day, in fact, the latest brand-new intelligence
from the Vienna factory is served up to Europe with
sauce so piquant as to betray its origin.</p>

<p class='c001'>The greater part of the so-called “news” concerning the
Balkans appearing in the English Press is utterly unreliable.
The correspondents, with few exceptions, are Austrians, and
also act as correspondents of the anti-Servian or anti-Bulgarian
papers printed in Vienna. From Austria these unscrupulous
scribblers gain more than from England, and
therefore we are allowed glimpses of the Balkans only through
Austrian spectacles. Spend a week in any Balkan city, and
you will in future heed none of the glib <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>canards</i></span> you read in
your responsible London morning paper regarding Servia
or Bulgaria.</p>

<p class='c001'>Austria and Turkey are for ever conspiring in the Balkans.
Austria has her eye on Servia, while Turkey intends, if possible,
to put her foot into Bulgaria, or at least to prevent the formation
of a “big Bulgaria.” As far as Turkey is concerned,
as long as the Sultan lives there will be no declaration of
war against Bulgaria. His Majesty’s death would, I fear,
be the declaration of war between the two countries—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>then the sallow-faced gentleman in fez and slippers will have an
unhappy time. The day of the Sultan’s death will put the
Balkans aflame, and then the map of the Peninsula will
assuredly be very quickly altered.</p>

<p class='c001'>But before then Bulgaria may declare war.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>My friend the spy—How I was watched through the Balkans—An exciting
half-hour—The Paris of the Near East—Gaiety, extravagance, and
pretty women—Forty years of progress—The paradise of the idler—Husbands
wanted!</p>

<p class='c007'>My friend the spy picked me up at Rustchuk.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was a well-dressed, middle-aged man, in a black
overcoat with a velvet collar. His face was sharply cut and
intelligent, but his dark eyes were set rather too closely together
to suit me. Suddenly I recollected having seen the same
man in the streets of Sofia a week before. Indeed, I saw him
frequently when in the Bulgarian capital, but until I met him
that night upon the Danube steamer, between Rustchuk and
Guirgevo, the thought never occurred to me that the fellow
was persistently following me.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, like a flash, each of the occasions I had seen him
came back to me. Not only had he followed me in Sofia, but
I now recollected having seen him in Belgrade and in Zimony.
The fellow was a spy—Austrian without a doubt. It was
not my first acquaintance with spies. I had met many of
them in the course of my wanderings up and down Europe.
Some, indeed, are among my personal acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c001'>Until you travel in the Balkans, and more especially if
you are having interviews with Ministers and officials, you
can have no idea of the audacity and activity of Austria’s
secret agents. They swarm everywhere. The Grand Hotel
at Belgrade is full of them, and in Sofia they also flourish as
part of the great secret army which the Austrian Government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>keeps in the East, from Zimony right down to Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a bitterly cold night, with slight drizzling rain. The
spy was standing on deck in the shadow at a little distance
from me. The recollection that I had with me a quantity
of official documents given and lent to me by the Servian
and Bulgarian Governments was the reverse of reassuring.
I felt in my pocket for my revolver. Yes, the handy little
weapon was ready for use, in case of necessity.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were only four or five passengers, and I knew that
across the Danube the Roumanian train taking me on to
Bucharest would be practically empty. And so it proved,
for after landing, getting my passport <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>viséd</i></span> and my baggage
through the Roumanian Customs, I walked to the train, to
find it empty, lit only by dim flickering oil-lamps, which gave
scarcely sufficient light to see into the corners of the compartments.</p>

<p class='c001'>I looked back, and yes, surely enough, the spy was following
me! I was alone, for I had sent my servant on to Bucharest
by the morning train. I got into a compartment, and presently,
after some man&oelig;uvring, he got in with me. I was
annoyed, but I had my weapon in my outside pocket, and
intended to fire through my pocket if he attempted to attack
me, or get at my despatch-box on the seat at my side.</p>

<p class='c001'>Calmly he lit a cigarette, then inquired in French—which
he spoke excellently—</p>

<p class='c001'>“M’sieur is going on to Bucharest? Ah! what a wretched
train service—eh? I suppose you go on to Constantinople?”</p>

<p class='c001'>I looked him straight in the face and replied—</p>

<p class='c001'>“My destination is no affair of yours, m’sieur. And I
have neither desire nor intention that you should follow me
any farther. You must think I’m blind. I saw you in
Servia a dozen times, and in Bulgaria afterwards, and here
you are in Roumania! Your game may be interesting to
yourself, but it is annoying to me, I can assure you—very
annoying.”</p>

<p>Snap-shots in Bucharest.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The fellow looked aghast. He was not clever at all; for
he stammered something in Hungarian, and then, in French,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>declared that he had never followed me. We had met and
re-met by accident, he assured me. That was all.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well,” I said, pretty sternly, “just take care that we
don’t meet again by accident after to-night. You understand?”
The train was moving, so he was compelled to
travel in the same compartment with me to the next stopping-place
on the fifty-mile run that separates the Danube from
the Roumanian capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know,” I went on, “that you think I have some official
documents with me that would be extremely interesting to
your employers. Yes, I admit I have had some, but I’m
scarcely such a fool as to travel about with them. They
would be interesting reading to you, but fortunately they
are already safe in London. So you are really only wasting
your valuable time, my dear monsieur.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“M’sieur quite misunderstands me—he takes common
politeness for inquisitiveness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I don’t want any of your polite attentions,” I
declared very bluntly; “and if you don’t get out at the
next station I shall just kick you out. You understand
that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>He saw I had my hand in my jacket-pocket all the time,
and doubtless guessed what I had there.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall stay here,” he answered defiantly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Excellent,” was my response. “And when we get to
the next station I shall call the gendarmes and have you
arrested as a foreign secret agent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You’ve made a great mistake,” he declared resentfully.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very well. Let’s see. You remain here, and I’ll call
the police.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He did not reply. For half an hour he sat quite silent,
while I, fearing treachery, kept my hand upon the trigger of
my weapon, for as a matter of fact I had with me some papers
of the very highest importance to Austria—papers that would
have compromised certain highly-placed persons in the Balkans.
The spy was evidently aware of this, and it was the motive of
his strenuous endeavour to seize an opportunity to get hold of
the confidential statements in question. In Roumania, as in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Servia, they treat foreign spies with scant courtesy, and the
fellow’s manner belied his defiant words.</p>

<p class='c001'>That half-hour was an exciting one, until at last, after
what seemed an interminable period, the train slowed down
and came to a standstill, when my inquisitive friend of evil
intentions descended, and without a word disappeared in
the darkness.</p>

<p class='c001'>I thought I had rid myself of his surveillance, but I was
mistaken. Next day I met him in the streets of Bucharest,
and so persistently did he follow me that I was compelled to
lodge a complaint with the police. As soon as I had done that,
I saw him no more. My own belief was that he was arrested.
He may be in prison now, for all I know. In any case, he
disappeared as completely as though the earth had swallowed
him up.</p>

<p class='c001'>This little incident, both annoying and exciting at the
time, was my first adventure on entering Roumania, but it
was soon forgotten amid the gaieties of smart Bucharest.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Roumanian capital is a place apart. Roumania is not
a Balkan State in any sense of the word, and has progressed
so rapidly during the forty odd years of its freedom that in
Bucharest to-day, save for Roumanian names over the shopfronts,
one may easily believe oneself to be in Paris or in
Brussels.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, some of the buildings, notably the new Post Office,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Academy, are unequalled
not only in Brussels, but even in Paris. Bucharest
is a gay city of external glitter, bright, merry, and highly
amusing after some of the dull, half-civilised country towns
in the Balkans. Smart cafés and confectioners, expensive
hotels, shops that charge double prices of those in Paris,
and theatres where one pays a sovereign for a stall, are all
to be found in Bucharest. The boulevards are broad and
full of life and movement, and the Calea Victoriei, the Boulevard
Carol, and Strad Lipsicani are as busy as any thoroughfare
of a Western capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nearly every public building has a dome, while the chief
object of a Roumanian seems to be to build for himself a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>wonderfully ornate house and gild the railings in front. Many
of the façades of the private houses are marvels of florid bad
taste. Again, though in the streets, in drawing-rooms and
at cafés and theatres, I met hundreds upon hundreds of
officers, crowds of lieutenants, swarms of captains and a good
sprinkling of generals, all in wonderful uniforms, yet I was
four days in Bucharest before I discovered a real soldier—and
then quite by accident. He wore a brown uniform, and
I mistook him for a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>wagon-lit</i></span> conductor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bucharest is a city of vivid contrasts—a wildly gay, go-ahead
city, which justly bears the reputation of being one of
the most expensive in the world. For the poor it is the
cheapest; for the rich, the dearest. Prices, for instance, at
the Hotel du Boulevard are higher than at the Savoy or
Carlton in London, yet everything is excellent, the sterlet
quite as good as at the Hermitage at Moscow, and the caviare
such as one only gets in the best restaurants in Russia.</p>

<p class='c001'>As one wanders in the streets the Western eye meets many
quaint sights. For instance, the <span lang="ro" xml:lang="ro"><i>birjas</i></span>, or cabs, are open
victorias drawn by a pair of long-tailed Russian horses,
and driven by men wearing great padded overcoats of blue-black
velvet—huge affairs that give them very portly proportions.
Around the waist is worn a piece of gaily coloured
satin ribbon,and on the head the round Balkan cap of astrachan.
Most of the drivers are Russian refugees, and form a distinct
class apart. Cabs are extremely cheap, and the rate at which
one is driven would be reckless were it not that the men have
such perfect control over their horses.</p>

<p class='c001'>The British colony is not a large one. Its head is, of
course, our Minister, Sir Conyngham Greene, in whose able
hands British interests in Roumania have recently been
placed. Keen and active, he has already rearranged our
Consular service in Roumania, and placed the Legation on
the same footing as those of the other Powers. While every
other European nation owns a Legation house in Bucharest,
we have none; and while I was in the Roumanian capital he
was a fellow-guest at the Hotel du Boulevard. It is understood,
however, that the Foreign Office—or the Treasury—have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>recently been shamed into the necessity of buying a
house, and very soon Sir Conyngham will have a fitting
residence, as the other representatives of the Powers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nobody ever deigns to walk in Bucharest. Everybody
takes cabs, therefore the streets are filled with vehicular traffic
till far into the night. At evening, indeed, Bucharest is at
her best. Smart restaurants, with pretty, well-dressed women,
cosy theatres, flash café-chantants, and noisy garish cafés
abound all over the town, while outside, notably at the Villa
Regala, in the centre of a park, smart dinners and suppers
are given.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>jeunesse dorée</i></span> are an effeminate and extravagant
crowd. Gambling permeates the whole of society, and large
sums are lost and won every evening. I know personally one
member of the Roumanian Cabinet who thinks nothing of
losing or winning a couple or three thousand pounds each
week at cards. He plays every afternoon at the Club, and
is always open to play any comer for any stake proposed, no
matter what it may be.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bucharest is a typical capital of a wealthy, easy-going
country. The people are charitable, and spend freely—when
they have it. The shop-windows, where the most expensive
table delicacies are displayed, show the foreigner the Roumanians’
extravagance in eating, while the dresses one sees
on the giddy women-folk are as up to date as any that one
notices in the Champs Elysées, the Bois, or at the Opera.
Yet amid all this up-to-dateness the old horse-tram still
survives and jogs along, and the patient white oxen toil
slowly through the streets, dragging their heavy springless
carts.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unlike Sofia, or in Belgrade, peasants are seldom met with
in the streets of Bucharest. One may go a whole week without
coming across a woman in national costume, unless, of course,
the market is specially visited. I, however, met, in Bucharest,
Mr. Harold Hartley, one of the directors of the Earl’s Court
Exhibition, and we made many pleasant excursions into the
country together. To the traveller from Western Europe the
city is highly interesting and full of curious types, especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>of the young elegant, whose present fashion, it seems, is to
shave only the front of his chin and cheeks and grow a
beard all round, very similar in cut to that of a monkey.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Boulevard Elisabeta: Bucharest.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When one recollects that about forty years ago Roumania
was a semi-civilised nation, and Bucharest a little Oriental
town, its present size and splendour are astounding. To
King Charles’ rule much of this progress is due, and in order
to celebrate the fortieth year of his reign there has recently
been held a very pretty Exhibition, a miniature of the great
Exhibition of Paris. It was, I found, most interesting, and
fortunately it has been decided to preserve several of the
more important buildings, including a really excellent replica
of a Roman amphitheatre. The gaming-room is also to be
preserved, of course, for the “little horses” have great attraction
for the merry people of Bucharest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, this Paris of the East is indeed a strange place, especially
to those used to Western morals and manners. Everyone
lives far above his income, for there seems no limit to extravagance.
Prices are often extortionate. As an example, I was
charged at one restaurant half a crown for a whisky-and-soda!
At a shop across the street the charge for the same
whisky was 6 fr. 50 c. a bottle.</p>

<p class='c001'>Several of the restaurants are excellent, notably the Enescu,
behind the royal palace, a big place, where the best Tzigane
music in Roumania is provided gratis. The gipsy band is
under one Christache Ciolac, a famous violinist, who one day
will no doubt make his mark in London. The orchestra of
the Enescu ought to be imported to one of our smart restaurants
and it would create a great sensation, for our present so-called
Roumanian music cannot be compared with the real thing.
Here, at Enescu’s, there is no dressing up in fancy costumes—not
even dress-coats. But the music is there, the strange weird
gipsy melodies and dances that run in one’s head for days
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cookery at Enescu’s, too, is perhaps the best in the
Roumanian capital. Next to it is the restaurant of the
Boulevard, where at luncheon there is a table set apart for
the diplomats, and is always occupied by the various young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>attachés and secretaries. After that, comes Capsa’s. The
feminine element in the restaurants at dinner is much the
same as it is at home, except that one often sees a mother and
two, or even three, daughters dining alone—dining in public,
so that they may be seen by some stray swain who is desirous
of marriage. One night at Enescu’s, at the table next to us,
sat an Italian duchess of ancient lineage married to a Roumanian
aristocrat, with her three pretty dark-eyed daughters
of varying ages, eating solemnly, the mother ever watchful
to see whether any man had his eye upon them. We afterwards
saw them near midnight at a café solemnly sipping
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>sirops</i></span> and looking mournful and woebegone. A diplomat
who was with me told me that her Grace had been in
Bucharest staying at an hotel for the past six months, trying
to get her daughters off her hands, and was now beginning
to be disgusted at her non-success.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Roumanian has a great hatred of the Jew. Perhaps
it is because his extravagance brings him so often into their
hands. But the country is full of Hebrews. The capital is
not over-burdened with them, but in some towns in Northern
Moldavia Jews are in the majority. Indeed, their total
number in the united provinces exceeds 300,000, or about one-twentieth
of the entire population, a larger ratio than in any
other country in the world. In most provincial towns they
have the monopoly of selling strong drinks, and are of course
ever ready to lend money to the peasant-proprietors. Were
it not for the fact that the law forbids any Jew from holding
landed property—or any foreigner, for the matter of that—half
the soil would probably soon be in their hands. The
Moldavian Jews speak a different language, wear a different
dress, and keep themselves aloof from their neighbours, just
as do the picturesque cabmen of Bucharest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Roumania can boast one artist who is really great, whose
name is N. J. Grigoresco. I was shown some of his works,
the property of Mr. Ernest Goodwin, of the Roumanian
Bank, and found that they were of the Barbizon school,
which is very natural, as he was a fellow-worker with
Millet. Without exception the work was excellent, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>believe there is some idea of having an exhibition of it in
London.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Bucharest there is none of the laziness or languor of the
Orient. Everyone is bent on business or upon pleasure,
and life for the idler is perhaps even more pleasant there
than in any other capital of Europe. Yes, Bucharest of
to-day astounds one in many ways.</p>

<p class='c015'>Monsieur Take Jonesco, Minister of Finance—The smartest man in Roumania—An
interview with General Lahovary, Minister of Foreign Affairs—Secret
aims of Roumania—A better frontier wanted—Germany’s
insincerity—Some plain truths—The question of a Balkan Federation—Oil

<p class='c007'>I had a number of interviews with the members of
the Roumanian Cabinet,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c024'><sup>[2]</sup></a> General Jacques Lahovary,
Minister for Foreign Affairs, and M. Take Jonesco, Minister
of Finance, being both particularly helpful to me in my inquiries
regarding Roumania’s political aims and aspirations.</p>

<hr class='c025' />
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Since this volume has been completed the Roumanian Cabinet has
resigned on account of the recent peasant rising, which, by the way, was
greatly exaggerated by the Austrian press.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c025' />

<p class='c001'>With the President of the Council, with General Manu,
Minister of War, and with M. Jean Lahovary, Minister of
Commerce, I also had long and interesting conversations.</p>

<p class='c001'>M. Take Jonesco struck me as by far the strongest and
shrewdest man in the present Cabinet. Keen, quick, and
far-seeing, he has of recent years played a prominent part
in bringing his country into its present satisfactory state.
Essentially a man of action, a smart politician, and a patriot,
he is nevertheless very English, for he has an English wife, and
his beautiful home is essentially English. Unlike most
statesmen in the East, he is frank and outspoken. He speaks
his mind fearlessly, and the Opposition hold him in terror.
Through his good offices I was afforded facilities for studying
various questions and forming my own conclusions. General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Lahovary, too, is a strong and brilliant man politically, of
essentially military bearing, with a clever countenance, a
long grey moustache, and wears a monocle with a tortoise-shell
rim.</p>

<p class='c001'>My audience with him was of an essentially confidential
nature. He told me many interesting things which, for the
present, it would be injudicious to publish, in view of the
strained relations between Bulgaria and Turkey. The Ministry
of Foreign Affairs is a millionaire’s palace—huge white-and-gold
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>salons</i></span>, with polished floors, fine pictures, and beautiful
gilt-and-red damask furniture. A showy millionaire built it
as his residence, and died soon afterwards. Then the Government
bought it for an old song, with the result that the Ministry
is housed in more gorgeous quarters than any other Ministry
in Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>From my inquiries in various political quarters in Bucharest,
both among members of the Government and the Opposition,
I found one unanimous view, that war between Turkey and
Bulgaria over Macedonia must come at an early date. In
Roumania the opinion is that even though a European prince
be appointed Governor-General of Macedonia, the war between
the two countries would only be postponed. It is believed
that Bulgaria is strong, and that the Stancioff policy will be to
resist the Turk by arms within a very few months.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Bulgaria hates the Turk, so does Roumania. But the
latter will not assist Bulgaria unless she gets some <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quid pro quo</i></span>.
This fact became very forcibly impressed upon me. Bulgaria
cannot attack Turkey without Roumania’s consent, so the
Roumanians declare. And moral support will only be given
on one condition. That is, if Bulgaria, as the result of the war,
annexes any Macedonian territory—as she naturally would
do—then she should cede to Roumania that portion of her
territory lying between the Danube and the Black Sea, taking
a line from a little east of Rustchuk to a little east of Varna.
Such condition is certainly not to be viewed in Bulgaria with
any satisfaction, yet as its acceptance would mean the extension
of Bulgaria to the Adriatic, the settlement of the Macedonian
question, and the final destruction of effete Turkey as a power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>in Europe, the Bulgarian Cabinet are considering it very
carefully.</p>

<p class='c001'>Roumania is not over-anxious to extend her territory, but
her present frontier between Rustchuk and the Black Sea is
one which she knows it would be impossible to defend in case
of hostilities. She therefore desires a better frontier, in order
that she can hold her own in time of war. Besides, she naturally
will want some of the spoils when the Turks and Greeks are
driven from Macedonia.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Roumanian policy is one of peace, combined with
firmness. General Lahovary is not a vacillating statesman.
His policy is one of progress, as his action towards Greece
over the ill-treatment of Roumanians in Macedonia has shown.
It is intended, no doubt, that the much-vexed question shall
not be settled without Roumania having a hand in it. As is
well known, Germany protects Roumania’s interests in Macedonia.
Through her, the Roumanian schools have been established
in Salonica, Monastir, and other places; but quite recently
the good relations with Germany have been somewhat lessened
owing to some friction regarding the exploitation of the
Roumanian oil wells by a German syndicate. The German
intention was to make a trust, which Roumania promptly
quashed by passing a special Act directed against them. It
is a curious fact that since this friction Germany has stood by
and witnessed the terrible atrocities committed by the Greek
bands upon the Roumanians in Macedonia without raising her
voice in protest. This, in itself, is sufficient to make one doubt
Germany’s sincerity, and certainly the eyes of the Roumanians
are already pretty wide open to the machinations of Berlin
in the Balkans.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conflict between Roumania and Greece—whatever
may be thought of the very recent discovery of Roumanians
in Macedonia—is quite simple. There are in Macedonia
undoubtedly a small percentage of the population which
speaks Roumanian, and who are appealing to their brothers
for protection to allow them to remain Roumanians. In
face of this appeal there are two courses of action possible.
One is to reply, “You are of no importance; you are so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>few; you are too far away; you cannot expect us to embroil
ourselves in foreign politics for your sake. And besides, our
ideals and our aspirations are different.” The other reply is
to adopt the course which, for the past forty years, all Roumanian
Governments have adopted, namely, to protect and
support their subjects abroad and look after their general
interests. Roumania has already done this in Macedonia. She
obtained an irade from the Sultan recognising the Roumanians
in Turkey as a nation apart, and giving them the right
to live as Roumanians. And what has been the result?
Bands of Greek <span lang="gr" xml:lang="gr"><i>antartes</i></span> at once crossed into Macedonia and
began to assassinate and torture every Roumanian subject
they could lay hands upon. Is it therefore any wonder that
diplomatic negotiations should be broken off between Bucharest
and Athens?</p>

<p class='c001'>The action of Roumania in pressing for the rights of
Roumanians in Macedonia and in obtaining the irade has,
of course, been the subject of much criticism in the European
press. M. Take Jonesco has been personally criticised as
having been the prime mover of the agitation of the past two
years. I mentioned it to him, and he denied that Roumania
had any ulterior motive in Macedonia save to protect her
subjects there and to allow them their own language, their
own religion, their own education, and give them freedom
to live as Roumanians. It was absurd, he declared, to
suggest that Roumania intended to acquire territory in
Macedonia, or that the Roumanian Valachs were of only
recent discovery. Their geographical position refuted the
first suggestion; and as to the second, he proved to me that
geographers and travellers had written about them a century
ago, one proof being that the English traveller Leake had
mentioned them in his book, published in 1814, saying that
the race in question were undoubtedly Roumanians. Leake
also says: “The Valachs occupy the centre of Macedonia
and Thessaly, and nearly all the Pindre, forming three principal
groups.” The Finance Minister also showed me the
evidence collected by the Roumanian writer, Nicholas Papahagi,
and recently issued under the title <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Les Roumains de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Turquie</i></span>. To me he proved most conclusively that the
Roumanian contention was at least well founded, and that the
European critics were incorrect in supposing that Roumania
wants territory in Macedonia. She may have her eye upon
that little strip of Bulgaria in order to strengthen her frontier,
and, I think, quite naturally. She knows that “a big Bulgaria”
is bound to arise. She can never hope to be of equal strength
with the Bulgar. Therefore she wants to entrench herself now
that there is a forthcoming opportunity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Both General Lahovary and M. Take Jonesco were
quite frank with me in their explanation of Roumania’s
future policy. Roumania knows that nowadays right, if
not supported by force, is not might. Grand words, if not
sustained by bayonets, bring serious men into ridicule.
During the past two years the Roumanian army has been
improved, consolidated, and brought into perfection. But
their intentions are entirely pacific, even though they have
not hesitated to augment the war budget, and will still
augment it if necessary. Roumania intends to remain passive
in the present Balkan complications, but if she finds it necessary
for the protection of her compatriots in Macedonia she
will, like Bulgaria, take arms against the Turk and drive him
back into his capital, and across into Asia Minor—which is
surely the best place for him.</p>

<p class='c001'>I spoke with several Roumanian statesmen upon the idea
of a Confederation of the Balkan States. Most of them
were in accord that such a thing was within the bounds of
possibility, but that it was very unlikely that Roumania
would ever enter such a Confederation. Roumanians are
fond of declaring that their country is not a Balkan State,
yet if such Confederation were formed it seems difficult to
see how Roumania could hold aloof.</p>

<div id='i248'  class='figcenter id006'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>Gen. Jacques Lahovary</span>, Roumanian Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is perhaps premature to talk seriously of such a
Confederation. In the various political quarters where I
referred to the question, I found that Roumanians considered
it at present very difficult of arrangement, and very dubious
whether Roumania could ever enter it. Events of the
last thirty years have considerably altered the map of Europe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>and in each case smaller States have been amalgamated into
kingdoms and empires, such as Italy and Germany. The
saying of King Corvin that “The kingdom which has not
one language is a mad kingdom” is, in our days, no longer
true, Austria being an example. The Serbs, the Bulgars,
the Greeks, and the Roumanians are widely separated by
language and by race. Yet, threatened on the one side by
Germany and the other by Austria, they may, in the near
future, find it judicious to combine, as the only way of preserving
their territory and independence. The difficulties of
the problem are, however, many. The Greeks and Bulgars
are at drawn swords, the Roumanians and Greeks have
broken off diplomatic negotiations, and between the Serbs and
Bulgars the feeling is not really so friendly as it should be.
At the bottom of all, too, we find the everlasting question of
Macedonia, which, in itself, must prevent a Confederation.
But if it is ever accomplished, then it will take a high place
in the general politics of Europe. Besides, it is improbable
that the Confederation could ever be formed without
objections being raised by the Powers, and it is very likely
a great war might result. In Roumania, therefore, the idea
of a Balkan Confederation is not regarded with great favour.
The first question of all is Macedonia—ever Macedonia, and
“the terrible Greek.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards the internal politics of Roumania, they are
not within the scope of this present volume. Both the
finance and commerce of the country seem to be in an excellent
state notwithstanding the recent dissatisfaction of the
peasantry. Thanks to the efforts of M. Jonesco, the finances
of the country are now in a thoroughly sound condition,
and every day sees greater prosperity. As I found in Servia
and in Bulgaria openings for British capital, so there is in
Roumania also many openings for British industrial enterprises,
especially weaving. The climate is not favourable for
cotton-spinning, but for weaving there are many enterprises
that would pay good dividends.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the petroleum wells there have been, since their discovery
fifteen years ago, about 150,000,000 francs of foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>capital invested. Greater part of this is German, but there is
also a French, Italian, and Dutch element in the various
companies exploiting the wells. The Standard Oil Company
of America have about 15,000,000 francs invested, but there
is no British enterprise. The oil is refined in Roumania,
but a good deal of crude oil is sent to France, as well as great
quantities of benzine.</p>

<p class='c001'>From Turn Severin, on the western border of the country,
the petroleum zone can be distinctly traced at the foot of the
Carpathian Mountains, skirting them in their course through
the country towards Bukovina and Galicia on the north-east.
Along the whole length of this zone are primitive hand-dug
wells, the workings prior to 1873, when the American oilfields
were discovered. Since 1895, however, a new stimulus
was given to the industry by the modification of the mining
laws, and from that date the oil industry has been gradually
increasing, and only awaits the introduction of British capital
to develop the enormous oil-fields.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is claimed that the Roumanian petroleum contains
14, 15 and 25 per cent. more pure oil than American, Galician,
or Caucasian oils respectively. The total production in 1905
was 602,000 tons, or double the production of four years ago,
while the export has nearly doubled in the past two years.
The Deutcher and Dresden Banks and the Disconto Gesellschaft
have about three million and a half pounds invested in it,
while a new company, called the “Trajan,” with a capital of
£200,000, has recently been formed, of which Marmorosch,
Blank, &amp; Co. of Bucharest, the principal promoters, have
taken two-fifths. It will absorb the “Helios” and several
other minor companies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very large areas of the Roumanian oil-fields are the property
of the State, and have hitherto been unworked, but
the Minister of Commerce, when I questioned him upon the
subject, informed me that a law recently passed by the Chamber
provides for the leasing of these lands to private companies,
though important provisos are introduced in order to prevent
monopolies. The Minister explained to me the chief points
of the new laws, and as they may interest British capitalists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>I give them. It appears that the Government may now lease
for a period of fifty years prospected or unprospected land of
maximum areas of 100 and 1000 hectares respectively. The
concession is granted to the party offering the highest rent.
No more than three lots can be leased to one concessionaire.
The capital, which must be at least 2,000,000 francs for every
100 hectare lot of prospected land or 1000 hectares of unprospected
land, must be deposited. Amalgamation or assignment
is illegal, and any secret fusion involves loss of the
concession. The State reserves to itself the exclusive right
of working all means of transport for petroleum, and will take
a compensation of at least 10 per cent. on the gross profit of the
working. Over and above that rent, the State participates
in the net profits of the working as follows: (1) one-third
should the net profit fluctuate between 10 and 30 per cent.;
(2) from 30 and more per cent., the share of the State is 50
per cent. of the net profits. The State levies upon concessionaires
a lease-charge of 20 francs per hectare, and in addition
the general taxes are to be paid. All concessions are subject
to Roumanian laws and regulations, and the State assumes
no responsibility for the profitableness of land leased.</p>

<p class='c001'>These conditions are certainly onerous, yet there is no
doubt a big field for British capital in Roumanian oil. The
Minister of Commerce impressed upon me this fact, and
declared that he would give every facility to intending concessionaires,
providing they were properly introduced, and
were persons who meant serious business.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the words of our Consul-General at Galatz, “It is
not very easy to account for the apathy of British capitalists
in seeking openings in Roumania. Perhaps its position in
the remote corner of Europe, and perhaps the difficulties of
language have something to do with it.” Anyhow, there is
a big future before the oil industry in Roumania, and it is
amazing that no one has yet had the courage to try the business
under the new conditions. As the Minister pointed out,
“The American Standard Oil Company are already firmly
established in Roumania. Why should not an English
company also work the fields?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>The future, and not a far-distant one, will no doubt see
many of the wells exploited by British capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Roumania there are also salt mines sufficient to supply
the whole world. The coal deposits are not numerous, but
iron and copper are known to exist, though they are not
yet exploited.</p>

<p class='c001'>I had an opportunity of examining the commercial statistics
for the present year, not yet published, and they showed
on the exports an augmentation on each of the past six years
of considerably over 100 million francs. This, in itself, speaks
volumes for the prosperity of this the most civilised and progressive
nation of the Orient, which has, no doubt, a greater
and far more brilliant future before it.</p>

the bowing liveried servants had conducted me through the
great entrance and up the large red-carpeted horse-shoe
staircase, I was struck with the old-fashioned comfort, combined
with taste, everywhere displayed.</p>

<p class='c001'>While chatting with Madame Bengesco, who was inquiring
after some mutual friends in Belgrade, I glanced around the
great salon or salons—for there are two of equal proportions,
the one running at right angles with the other. Splendid
old brocade-covered furniture, tables with interesting knick-knacks,
a grand piano, the fine organ upon which Her Majesty
so often plays, beautiful hangings, magnificent paintings upon
the walls and old Persian rugs upon the polished floor, all
combined, under the soft electric light, to produce a harmony
of quiet taste and luxury.</p>

<p class='c001'>The salons were huge, high-ceilinged, and splendid, yet
there was an air of homeliness about them, and indeed about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>the whole palace, that I have not found in other royal palaces
of Europe wherein I have been received. The great quiet
room bore traces of the artistic hand of Her Majesty herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>I had asked for audience not without some misgiving,
for His Majesty the King was lying very ill, and the Queen—the
“Carmen Sylva” of European literary fame—was at his
bedside always, administering to her sick husband’s wants,
nursing him, and reading aloud to him for hours each day.
For weeks she had given audience to no one, therefore it
was a pleasant surprise when Madame Maurojeni told me that
the Queen was going to make an exception in my case.</p>

<p class='c001'>I was chatting with Madame Bengesco, and suddenly
turned to find Her Majesty—a tall, fine figure <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en décolletée</i></span>,
a sweet smile of welcome upon her face—standing before me.
She wore a very handsome gown of pale dove-grey <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>crêpe-de-chine</i></span>,
but no jewellery save a single gold bracelet and one
or two very fine rings.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So you have come to see our country, Mr. N——?”
Her Majesty exclaimed in English, smiling pleasantly, after
I had made my obeisance, and she had shaken hands with
me. “Come, let us sit over in that corner. It is more
cosy.” And she conducted me to a luxurious little corner of
the salon, while the lady-in-waiting retired.</p>

<p class='c001'>I began by thanking Her Majesty for giving me audience
at such a time of anxiety.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have just left the King to come to you,” she answered.
“He is very much better, I am thankful to say, and yesterday
took a little nourishment. Ah yes, it has been a most
anxious time for me. You will forgive me if I am a little
tired, won’t you? When I heard you were in Bucharest
I determined to meet you. I have heard of you, long ago,
you know! Now, tell me, what brings you to Roumania?”</p>

<p class='c001'>I explained that my confidential mission was to inquire
into the future of the Balkans, whereupon she interrupted
me with that sweet laugh that is one of her characteristics,
saying—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, you must never include us in the Balkan States,
recollect! We Roumanians speak another language; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Danube separates us from the Balkans, and we have nothing
in common with the races on the other side of the river. The
reason why we are not taking part in this year’s Exhibition
at your Earl’s Court is because they have called it ‘The
Balkan Exhibition.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>I laughingly promised to be very careful on the point
in future. As she sat before me, the handsome, thoughtful
countenance, the white hair brushed straight back, and the
soft and very becoming head-dress, Her Majesty was surely
the most picturesque, the most interesting, and perhaps the
most accomplished and intelligent of the Queens of Europe.</p>

<p class='c001'>I told her of my journey through Northern Albania,
in which she was deeply interested, and asked me lots of
questions. Then I explained how I was on my way to
Constantinople and through Macedonia, whereupon she
made a quick gesture with her hands, and exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then you are studying Macedonia! Ah, what a very
difficult task you have! We have Roumanians in Macedonia,
as you know—and, poor people, they are being treated very
badly. What the outcome of it all is to be, who can tell?
There are so many conflicting peoples, so many conflicting
interests, so much jealousy among the Powers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! I see that your Majesty takes an interest in politics!”
I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No. You are mistaken,” she answered. “I, of course,
know the general outlines of most of the subjects, but I am
a woman, and am not expected to be a politician. My sphere
lies in endeavouring to do good to the people, to ameliorate
their sufferings, and to look after my various charitable
institutions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Surely the name of Carmen Sylva—that sweet-faced,
womanly woman who, though a queen, is so charming and unassuming—is
synonymous with all that is good and charitable.
For Roumania, she has done what no other woman has done.
Nearly all the charity of the country has been initiated, and
partly supported, by her efforts. She lives her life for the
poor and needy, and has worked hard for years on their behalf.</p>

<p class='c001'>In society in Bucharest I had heard some talk of her great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>interest in the blind, and that one of her protégés, himself a
blind man, had invented a machine by which the Braille type
for blind-books could be printed by type, instead of, as hitherto,
being embossed by hand. This subject I referred to, when at
once her eyes shone with enthusiasm and she said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then if you would like to know all about it, Mr. N——,
I’ll tell you. It all came about in this way. Some years ago
I had, as copyist, a servant, quite a poor man. His young
wife and his children had died, and, poor fellow, he was in the
greatest depths of despair when I took him into my service.
So I gave him very hard work to do, in order that his mind
should be occupied and he should forget. Well, time went on,
and I was always much interested in the welfare of the blind,
when one day this servant came to me and told me that a
certain blind man named Theodorescu, whom we had rescued,
was making experiments whereby the Braille books could be
multiplied by printing, and thus place reading and instruction
in the hands of every blind person in the world. This, I saw,
would mean light in the darkness of the afflicted, so we provided
the poor fellow with means to perfect his invention,
with the result that he produced a rough and somewhat incomplete
process. This was then taken over by Mr. Monske, an
old servant of mine, who worked here in a room in the palace
for over a year trying to perfect the machine. We made no
mention of it to a soul, but kept it a dead secret, until at last
success came, and now it is patented over the whole world—the
first complete machine for printing books for the blind!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you many blind in Roumania?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They say we have twenty thousand. But I believe we
have many more, because already in Bucharest the police have
discovered for me many more than were shown upon their statistics.
But let me tell you what the outcome of this invention
is, and what it will be,” the Queen went on. “I have recently
started a small blind institution, where the books will eventually
be printed. I might tell you that some time ago, before
the invention was perfected, we sent for an American machine,
a cumbersome affair, which cost three thousand francs. Our
machine will cost only three hundred francs. A Vienna
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>firm wished to manufacture them, but I preferred that they
should be made here, in Roumania. Well, our small institution—which
is under the direction of Mr. Monske and his wife—is
already in working order. See”—and she rose and took
me across the salon, where there were a number of photographs
arranged in a big frame surmounted by the royal crown and
cipher, copies of which are reproduced in these pages.</p>

<div id='i256'  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Queen of Roumania’s Blind Institute in Bucharest.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>“Here, you see, are some pictures which the photographer
very kindly sent me. Aren’t they interesting? Here is the
first child we found. He’s an intelligent little chap, with
musical instincts evidently, for I was told a few days ago
that he had been found trying to play four instruments at
once! Here you see them basket-making—here they are
having a concert—and here is a group—and so on. Aren’t
they interesting?” she asked enthusiastically. “And to
think that they were nearly all found as beggars. Some are
men who have been in good positions. That man was an
officer, for instance!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Her Majesty went back to her seat, and I reseated
myself with her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The present institution is only the beginning,” she said.
“I have a scheme for establishing a city for the blind—a model
town, to which the blind of every nation may come and work,
and support themselves. Now I will tell you something
about it. When it was known that I intended to do this,
people came forward on every hand to give me assistance.
One gentleman gave me 100,000 francs, while a lady has given
me the site for the city near Sinaia, a beautiful place where,
close by, we have a castle. The site is an ideal one, and very
shortly we shall lay it out with model houses built in modern
style, in which two families can live. We do not wish to
separate a blind man from his family, but the kitchens will be
in common, so that the wife may be relieved of much of her
household duties and afforded time to work and earn money.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We have several model villages in England, your Majesty,”
I remarked. “The one called Port Sunlight might interest
you. I could perhaps get photographs from Mr. Lever, who
built it.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Oh, do. It would be so kind of you. Will you ask him?”
she said. “I might get some excellent ideas from Mr. Lever’s
scheme. Of course we must have a working men’s club, a
concert hall, a church, and recreation room.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what does your Majesty call your present institution?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In Roumanian it is ‘The Hearth of Light,’ but in English
it would be better translated as ‘The Home of Light.’ Would
you like to visit it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should be delighted,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then Monske shall call for you and show you everything.
Remember that the people are not paupers. From the first
day they come to us they receive one franc a day, which is
increased according to the skill they show in chair-making,
basket-making, rope-making, and other such industries. As
regards the blind city scheme, Mrs. Fern, wife of a former
American Minister here, is starting for the United States in
a few days, and is taking one of the new machines with her,
and is going to hold conferences and explain the scheme in
the principal cities of America. You see now, for the first
time, education is fully open to the blind. The books will
be printed as easily as other books, and will be within the
reach of all. It is a splendid thing—and I am happy to say
that I am receiving donations from every side. I have
worked for years, and now the people are, I am gratified to
think, appreciating my efforts in the cause of humanity.
Yesterday Monske came to me and showed me 500 francs he
had that day received. I held up notes for 7000 francs, which
I had also received. One firm has sent me a magnificent
organ, and I have even poor families subscribing a franc a
month towards the blind. Does not that show that in the
hearts of the people there is a corner for the poor afflicted?
But remember that the blind colony is to be open to all
nationalities. It is a big undertaking, I admit; for I have
in Roumania twenty thousand people and their families.
Yet the scheme will work, I am confident. And while they
are now in penury, they will soon be educated, and be able to
place themselves, by their work, in a position of independence.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>For over an hour we chatted together, until, after promising
to send me a signed photograph of herself and of the King,
she rose, saying—</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am so delighted to have had a chat with you, Mr.
N——. I will send Mr. Monske to you in the morning.
But the King is alone, and will want me to read again to
him, so I must go.” And Her Majesty, smiling graciously,
gave me her hand, saying, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Au revoir.</i></span>”</p>

<p class='c001'>I bowed over it, thanked her for the audience, and retired,
charmed by her marvellous personality, her sweet silver
voice, her kindly manner, and her queenly bearing, all of
which combined to create an impression which will always
remain with me—an hour spent with a woman who is unique
in the whole world.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next day Her Majesty sent me the autographed photograph
which appears on another page, together with a very
charming note of thanks for a slight service I had been able
to render her.</p>

<p class='c001'>One morning a few days later, by the Queen’s order,
I was shown over her Blind Institute, which is called the
“Vatra Luminoasa Regina Elizaveta,” and is in the Boulevardul
Carol, in Bucharest.</p>

<p class='c001'>A large comfortable house, standing back from the road
in its own grounds, it is the first institution to be founded
under the new scheme, and the nucleus of what will most
certainly become a great and important charitable work. Mr.
Monske, the Director, a pleasant-faced, youngish man, with a
bright, open expression, received me, in the business-like
office, where a blind typist was busy with correspondence,
using a Remington machine with celluloid caps on each third
key.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah!” exclaimed the poor afflicted typist in French,
“you do not know what this place means to us! Take myself,
for example. I was a clerk in an office here, in Bucharest,
and eight years ago I went totally blind. My life after my
misfortune was one of misery. I was in the depths of despair,
for the blind are not wanted on the earth. And then came
the good Queen, and saved me. My story is the same as all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>of us here—lifted out of despair and placed in a position of
comfort and independence, for all of us are paid for our work.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The poor clerk seemed thankful from the very bottom
of his heart. He was full of praise of Her Majesty’s great
goodness, and the kindness of the private persons helping
her. Of Mr. Monske he sang praises, and then when he
was told who and what I was, he asked me in the name of
his fellow-inmates of the Institute to tell the English what
a grand and noble work “Carmen Sylva” was doing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Monske then took me to the music-room, a large bright
apartment with a fine organ,—the gift of a blind Austrian
gentleman,—two pianos, and other musical instruments. On
the walls were the portraits of the King and Queen, while the
floor was of polished oak. Here, one afternoon each week,
Her Majesty comes, accompanied by her ladies-in-waiting and
some friends, and gives the blind inmates and their families
a musical entertainment. Thus the Queen keeps the Institute
under her own personal supervision.</p>

<p class='c001'>In another room—a play-room—I saw a homely-looking
woman playing with a little blind child of four years, while
the oldest inmate I saw was about sixty. The dormitories
for the thirty-two inmates that were there at the time of my
visit were scrupulously clean and very airy. Each man had
his bed, his washstand, his lock-up wardrobe, while the floors
everywhere were covered with linoleum.</p>

<p class='c001'>I was taken to a long new building, just erected in the
grounds, which is being fitted as a rope-works. There is room
for thirty men to work with ease. Close beside it is about
to be erected a private chapel, given by a gentleman in
Bucharest, while on the other side of the house I was shown
the chair-making workshops, the overseer of which was a blind
man himself. Here, while some were expert menders of cane
chairs, others were being taught the trade. The Director
explained that he had just signed a big contract with a firm
of chair-makers, and showed me the hundreds upon hundreds
of frames ready to go into the hands of the blind.</p>

<div id='i260'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_260fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Blind Inmates at Work.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The last department I was shown was that in which the
new Theodorescu machine was being used to emboss blind-books.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>It is an interesting and ingenious method by which
the type, consisting of small blunt pins, is set in a brass frame
very similar to ordinary type, and is set indeed by the blind
themselves. Then, when a frame is full, it is put into a special
press, and any number of impressions can be taken from the
embossing-pins.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Monske first reduces the printed book to embossed
Braille characters, and these are set up by the blind compositors,
and impressions taken very rapidly. I was shown bulky
volumes of well-known works that have already been printed
in this manner and now, for the first time, given to the blind.
Recently Mr. Monske made a tour to the various blind institutions
in France, Austria, and Germany, and without any prospectus,
sold 140 of the machines. It certainly is a simple but
most ingenious invention, which in the future will bring great
profits to the Queen’s blind colony.</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards private subscriptions, I was shown the list.
They range from 50 centimes to £4000. On the day previous
to my visit it was shown by the list that Her Majesty had
received over 5000 francs in donations. Funds are coming in, it
is true, but for the development of the scheme a large sum is
required. It is for that reason that Her Majesty is making an
earnest appeal all over the world to those interested in the
welfare of the blind. Her great institution—of which this is
only the nucleus—is an international one, and men and their
families of all creeds and nationalities are eligible. Her
Majesty has asked me to say that subscriptions, however
small, can be sent either to Madame Zoe Bengesco, Dame
d’Honneur to the Queen of Roumania, Bucharest, or to Mr.
R. Monske, Director “Vatra Luminoasa Regina Elizaveta,”
Boulevardul Carol 31, Bucharest, and would be duly acknowledged.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The Orient Express again—On the Black Sea to Constantinople—A disenchantment—My
dragoman—How to bribe the Customs officers—Mud
and dogs—A city of spies—Feebleness of British policy at the Porte—Turkish
adoration of Germany—The basis of my confidential inquiries.</p>

<p class='c007'>From Bucharest to Constantinople is not at all an unpleasant
journey.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Orient Express runs twice a week to Constantza,
the Roumanian port on the Black Sea, where there is a fine
and comfortable passenger-steamer service direct to Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Bucharest Station I was seen off by several kind friends,
with many parting injunctions to “take care of myself” in
Macedonia, and it was not without regret that I left the gay
little Roumanian capital, where I had received so much
hospitality, from Her Majesty the Queen down to some of
the humblest of her subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>The “Orient,” on the Constantza line, is not so well
fitted, nor is the food so good, as upon the direct line from
Paris to Constantinople by way of Belgrade and Sofia.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole train was shabby, dusty, and over-heated,
and the dinner, instead of the usual <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>table d’hôte</i></span>, was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à la carte</i></span>.
The only item on the bill of fare, however, proved to be beef-steak.
The small piece cooked for me was fit only for a dog,
and served on a dirty tablecloth; therefore I was compelled
to make my dinner off stale bread and soapy cheese. And
this on a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>train de luxe</i></span>—and one of the principal European
Expresses!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>The Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits et Grand
Express Européenes are not very considerate towards travellers
to the East. There is neither competition in sleeping
accommodation nor buffets, therefore the rolling-stock is often
old-fashioned and dirty, and the food leaves very much to be
desired. Surely upon a journey of three or four days, the
maximum degree of comfort should be secured! Why should
the traveller who spends one night between Calais and Nice
be better provided for than he who goes East from Ostend
to Constantinople—a four days’ journey?</p>

<p class='c001'>In the “Orient,” the old-fashioned coal-fire heating in
every carriage is still in vogue, and consequently the person
who is unfortunate enough to have a berth near the stove
is half roasted, while he who is at the farther end is half
frozen. The traveller who goes East would certainly welcome
the up-to-date <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>wagons-lits</i></span> of the Mediterranean or Carlsbad
Expresses.</p>

<p class='c001'>I travelled in the “Orient” from Paris to Vienna, from
Belgrade to Sofia, from Bucharest to Constantza, and from
Nisch in Servia to Paris, and on each of the trains were the
same defects in sleeping comfort, and often in food.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is to be hoped that the Company will shortly remedy
this, for on some of their routes, notably Calais-Paris, or
Paris-Marseilles, the food is all that can be desired.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Express, after passing the wonderful bridge over
the Danube, arrives at the quay at Constantza, or Kustendji,
as is its local name, at eleven o’clock at night, where the
mails from London and Vienna are quickly transferred on
board, and we are soon under steam, with the flashing light
of Cape Tusla fast disappearing at the stern.</p>

<p class='c001'>The steamer <i>King Charles</i> makes the voyage from
Constantza to Alexandria, calling at Constantinople, and is a
very comfortable and up-to-date boat, with excellent state-rooms
and a fine saloon, and ladies’ drawing-room. Officers
and men are Roumanians, but as the head steward speaks
French there is no difficulty. An excellent supper at midnight,
with Roumanian white wine, caviare, and a glass of <span lang="ro" xml:lang="ro"><i>slivovitza</i></span>
to follow, and then a stroll on the deck in the white moonlight.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Past the Kamara and Shabaloh lights, we at last see
the broad rays from the Kali Akra, and then we head straight
out upon the lonely sea for the Bosphorus. One by one, the
tired travellers, some of them from Ostend, Berlin, or Petersburg,
make for their berths, and finding myself alone, I turn
into the comfortable deck cabin kindly secured for me by
telegram by my friend the Minister of Finance in Bucharest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rising early, I was already out on deck and taking
photographs as we passed the two Turkish forts, Kilia and
Poiraz, at the narrow entrance to the Bosphorus. And after
stopping to take up our pilot, we crept slowly up the narrow
channel amid delightful scenery, some of which I photographed
and have reproduced in these pages, past the pretty
summer resort of Therapia and Anatoli Hissar, until we
approached the capital of Turkey, with her hundred domes
and minarets, looking almost like a fairy city against the
blue cloudless sky as we approached.</p>

<p class='c001'>But what a disenchantment on landing! That terrible
rabble at Galata in the midst of dirt and squalor, of shouting
touts, scrambling porters, and scavenger dogs, is a thing
to be ever remembered. Fortunately, I had a Greek dragoman,
one Demosthenes Cambothecras, to meet me. I can
recommend him as an excellent and honest fellow, and to the
intending traveller I may say that a letter addressed to the
Pera Palace Hotel will always find him.</p>

<p class='c001'>He stood on the quay amid the thousand off-scum of
Constantinople, and shouted my name. I shouted back, and
ten minutes later we met. When I gave him over my baggage
ticket, he said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“The customs here, m’sieur, are difficult. But, with
your permission, I will give the officer five francs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I assented readily, and my luggage was passed without
inquiry, while that of a bespectacled Hungarian next me
was examined piece by piece, greatly to the disgust and consternation
of his obese wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>I saw no money pass in the shabby, shed-like Custom
House, but he told me that the chief of the Customs
employed an agent out in the street to receive his bribes!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>So much for the morality of the Custom dues in Turkey.
In that very same week the British Ambassador had made
protest to the Sublime Porte regarding the same thing, but
was promptly “snuffed out” by the all-influential Power,
Germany.</p>

<p class='c001'>Germany and German interests are always paramount in
Turkey. If you are an Englishman, you may take a back
seat and endure all your passport worries, but the German is,
by the Turk, supposed to be his friend. German diplomacy
is clever, wary, and unscrupulous, and in the Sultan’s capital
you are treated with deference if you are a subject of the
Kaiser William.</p>

<p class='c001'>And how strange and ridiculous it all is! Germany intends
ere long to wipe Turkey off the face of Europe—only Turkey
cannot see it. She is fascinated and spellbound by German
cringing and German goodwill, all pretence, and all directed
towards the one end of traitorous abandonment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Great Britain, notwithstanding her fine Embassy, is entirely
eclipsed by the big white palace overlooking the Bosphorus
which houses the German Ambassador. Tewfik Pasha, the
Sultan’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, lives beneath its shadow,
and the Turks look upon Germany as their natural protector
and friend. A British protest to the Porte passes unheeded,
while a German protest receives attention and adjustment
the very next day. A German diplomatist at the Sublime
Porte told me this with a roar of laughter, adding—</p>

<p class='c001'>“We are the only diplomatists here. We are listened
to. You are merely tolerated.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And verily he spoke a great truth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our big grey Embassy in Pera, with its gorgeous Montenegrin
<i>kavass</i>, may be extremely ornamental and impressive,
but nowadays of little use. The British taxpayer is paying
for the glorification of Great Britain without one single farthing’s
worth of benefit. The Turkish Government—clever as they
are—laugh in the face of our persevering and well-meaning
Ambassador. They give him, or his representative, cups of
rather badly-made coffee in Tewfik’s shabby anteroom at the
Sublime Porte, and put their fingers to their noses behind his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>back. It is not the fault of our Ambassador, or of his staff.
All of them are practised diplomatists, who endeavour to their
utmost to do their duty to King and Country, and to protect
British interests in the East. The fault lies in the timid policy
and shrinking politeness adopted by our present Government.
The late lamented Lord Salisbury, or Lord Beaconsfield, would
never for a moment have submitted to the open rebuffs which
Great Britain daily meets with nowadays at Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Turk knows that Germany is behind him, and is therefore
defiant. So British diplomacy is beaten every time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Constantinople swarms with spies. If you have ever
been there, and landed from a steamer, you will recollect that
a crowd of unwashed porters swarm on board directly the ship
is made fast. Every man of that ragged rabble is a spy. He
is only allowed on board on condition that he gives information
to the Custom officers ashore as to any concealment of
revolvers, books, or prohibited articles. Respectable dragomans
are constantly asked to assist in this, and offered monetary
reward, as well as a permit to board the ship, but they refuse—and
leave the espionage to the rabble.</p>

<p class='c001'>And so it is all through the Turkish capital. Spies are
everywhere—they haunt one in all the hotels, even in the
much-advertised Pera Palace—and every movement of the
stranger is noted. If you happen to be a German and have
shown your passport in the Custom House, then you go hither
and thither and do whatever you like. But if you are of any
other nationality you will be suspected and haunted by all
sorts and conditions of secret agents, until you kick the mud
of Constantinople off your boots.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have been more than once in the Sultan’s capital, and on
each occasion, on entering it, have been seized with a fit of
depression, which has only been removed when I have got
my passport <i>viséd</i> by the British Consul-General, and also
by the Turkish police, preliminary to leaving the place.</p>

<p class='c001'>The squalor in Galata, in Stamboul, and even in aristocratic
Pera, sickens one. The streets, unswept for ages, are
an inch deep in slimy mud, upon which one slides and slips at
every step, and the grey, wolf-like dogs, held sacred by every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Turk, prowl about in hordes, each in their own quarter, living
in the streets and sleeping in doorways.</p>

<p class='c001'>Constantinople, with the most picturesque and beautiful
position in all the world, is the most filthy and uncomfortable
of all cities. With the exception of the Grande Rue, at Pera,
there is scarcely a single decent European business street.
Every thoroughfare is crowded to excess by a motley throng
of Mohammedans, both European and Asiatic, and every form
of costume and physiognomy, from the Tartar to the Syrian,
may be seen.</p>

<p class='c001'>The pilgrimages were leaving for Mecca while I was there,
and the whole city was filled with the Faithful from every
part of the great Moslem world. The bridge at Galata was
daily a perfect panorama of costume as the pilgrims assembled
to embark.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though I spent a little time in the great Bazaar—which
is always attractive to the traveller from the West—and revisited
Saint Sophia and other of the big mosques, my days in
Constantinople were mostly occupied in having interesting
chats with the heads of the Turkish Government.</p>

<p class='c001'>I carried letters of introduction to His Excellency Tewfik
Pasha, the Sultan’s Minister of Foreign Affairs; to the Grand
Vizier of the Sultan; to d’Aristarchi Bey, the Grand Logothete;
to His Excellency Noury Pasha, Under-State Secretary for
Foreign Affairs; to the British Chargé d’Affaires, Mr. Geo.
H. Barclay—the Ambassador being absent on leave; to His
Excellency Monsieur George Simitch, the Servian Minister; to
M. Dimetri Vlastari, the well-known banker; to Mehemed Ali
Pasha; to Riza Pasha, Minister of War; and to many other of
the leading people in the Turkish capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus I was enabled to go thoroughly into the present
state of affairs. I was granted an audience of His Majesty
the Sultan, as well as by the Grand Vizier, by Tewfik Pasha,
the Khardjie-Naziri, and had many interviews with the
persons named above.</p>

<p class='c001'>My inquiries were mainly directed to ascertaining—first,
what attitude Turkey was assuming towards Macedonia;
secondly, whether the Turks were alive to the firm intention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>of Bulgaria for the protection of her subjects, and in what
manner they viewed the prospect of hostilities; thirdly,
the truth about the Macedonian reforms; fourthly, the
extent of German intrigue in Constantinople; fifthly, the
Turkish policy towards Austria; and sixthly, the policy
towards Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c001'>I went to the Porte in order to penetrate the veil of
mystery surrounding diplomacy there, and to get at the true
state of affairs. The task was very difficult, for in the East
one is hardly ever told the real facts about anything. Nevertheless,
unique opportunities were afforded me to obtain
knowledge by the absolute facts and the future aims of both
Turkey and Germany—opportunities of which, as will be shown
in the following pages, I was not slow in taking advantage.</p>

<p class='c001'>In view of the present situation in Turkey, the proclamation
of the “Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress,”
which was found posted upon all the walls of the Pera quarter
of Constantinople on January 1 of this present year, is of
great interest in showing the present state of public feeling in
the Turkish capital.</p>

<p class='c001'>This proclamation, which was issued by a very strong and
formidable party in Turkey, began by stating that Abdul
Hamid, after thirty years of impunity, was now on the verge
of death. The fact that now and then he gives audience of a
few minutes’ duration to an Ambassador, or that at the weekly
Selamlik he drives to the mosque, a few yards from his palace,
proves nothing. The Sultan Mahmud fell dead from his
horse, returning from the Selamlik; while the Sultan Medjid
was on his feet up to the very last. In reality Abdul Hamid,
knowing the profound effect which his failure to attend the
Selamlik would have upon the people, is expending all the
energies that remain to him in fulfilling this religious observance
and in granting an occasional interview to a foreign
Ambassador.</p>

<p class='c001'>The proclamation proceeded:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“During the thirty years of his reign Abdul Hamid has
brought ruin on the land; one half of our patrimony he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>has delivered to the enemy; he has destroyed our fleet,
disorganised our army; he has reduced the people to
misery; he has annihilated our governmental system, and
has left nothing to the civil organisation or the civilisation
of the past. He has concentrated the whole government
into his own hands, and has dismissed all his tried and
experienced Ministers, transferring the reins of office to
self-seekers and traitors willing to become his tools.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Grave troubles are predicted after his death, and the
Committee urges the population of the Empire, Christian
and Mussulman, to be on their guard and to consider seriously
the following facts:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“(1) Abdul Hamid and his accomplices are conspiring
to hand over the sovereignty and the Caliphate to his
fourth son, the youth, Burhaneddin, in defiance of the
tradition and the civil and religious law of the Empire.
The success of this stratagem would be a mortal blow
to the aspirations of the nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>“(2) To prevent the enemies of the country from provoking
disorders in order to bring about foreign intervention,
guarantees must be given to the Christian
populations and, if necessary, written assurances to the
Embassies.</p>

<p class='c001'>“(3) The happiness and the future of the country
being dependent upon the suppression of the despotic
régime and the enforcing of the Constitution, which was
recognised in 1876 as an inalienable right of the nation,
and after being two years in operation was perfidiously
abrogated by Abdul Hamid, our fellow-countrymen,
Christian and Mussulman, must of one accord exact the
application of that Constitution, which will restore to the
country its vitality and safeguard the liberties of the people.
United in heart and mind, the Ulemas, the notables
of the capital and the provinces, must, through the intermediary
of the Grand Vizier and the Valis, demand of the
new Sultan that he proclaim and bring into force without
delay the clauses of the Constitution.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“(4) The duty of preserving the essential rights of
the nation belongs, above all, to the members of the guild
of the Ulemas and to the high civil and military officials;
the ceremony of the Biat, when the chosen of the people
demonstrate the popular sovereignty by recognising and
accepting the new Sultan, is the most propitious occasion
for the exercise of that duty. It is an obligation that
lies upon every Turkish subject to exact a pledge from
the delegate he sends up to do his duty on that occasion.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The Manifesto ended with an appeal to the Christian and
non-Christian populations to prepare for the coming crisis.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>His Excellency Noury Pasha—A quiet chat at his home—Turkish view of
European criticism—The Turk misunderstood—The massacres in
Macedonia—My visit to the Sublime Porte—His Excellency Tewfik
Pasha tells me the truth—A great diplomatist—The fashion to denounce
Turkey—The attitude of the Porte towards Bulgaria—Significant
words.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first visit I paid was to His Excellency Mehmed
Noury Pasha, Secretary-General of the Imperial Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, who is one of the most advanced and progressive
of Turks, and who, next to Tewfik Pasha, the Sultan’s
Foreign Minister, is one of the most powerful men in Turkey.</p>

<p class='c001'>As such, it may be interesting to note that he was born
in Constantinople, and having made his early studies in that
city, was sent by the Sultan to Paris, where he underwent
a long course of training, returning to occupy the post of
Inspector in the Ministry of Public Works. Afterwards, he
became Director-General, and subsequently his perfect
knowledge of French brought him again before the notice of
the Sultan, who appointed him to the office of Secretary-General
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a position which
he has held for the past eighteen years.</p>

<p class='c001'>Through his hands all diplomatic correspondence passes,
and to him is mainly due the clever and tactful diplomacy
of the Porte. His is, indeed, a delicate and laborious task.</p>

<div id='i274'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_274fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>His Excellency Noury Pasha.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He is a slim, fair-bearded, middle-aged man of very charming
manner, and a delightful companion; shrewd, full of tact
and clear discernment. Times without number he has given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>proof of assiduous work for his country’s advancement, and
no one knows better than he the defects of Turkish rule.</p>

<p class='c001'>By no means bigoted, he is, on the contrary, broad-minded
and eager for reform. He was sent by the Sultan to represent
him at Rome at the silver wedding of the King and Queen of
Italy in 1893, and later, was one of the Peace delegates at
the Conference after the Greco-Turkish War. He acted as
second delegate of the Ottoman Empire at the Conference at
Rome against the Anarchists, and also at the Peace Conference
at The Hague.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this latter Conference he won golden opinions from
all the delegates of the other Powers for his politeness, his
charm of manner, and the clever tact with which he performed
his somewhat difficult mission.</p>

<p class='c001'>Few, if any, of the dignitaries of Constantinople possess
such a wide knowledge of Europe, European ways, and European
politics. Enjoying the full confidence of the Sultan and of
the Sublime Porte, he is recognised by the foreign missions
as the working head of the Department of Foreign Affairs.
He is the right hand of his chief, Tewfik Pasha, whom he aids
with all his intelligence in the incessant difficulties which beset
Turkish diplomacy. As a mark of their esteem he has been
decorated by nearly every sovereign in Europe, while the
Sultan has given him the plaque in brilliants of the Orders
of Osmanie and the Medjidie.</p>

<p class='c001'>Noury Pasha being well known to me as one of the cleverest
men in Turkey, it afforded me great pleasure to obtain a
chat with him one evening in the quiet of his own home.</p>

<p class='c001'>He received me in a cosy room on the ground floor, a room
that was more European than Turkish, and where I noticed
many signed photographs of the chief diplomatists of Europe
who are his friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we were seated, a man-servant brought us the
inevitable tiny cup of excellent coffee, and delicious cigarettes,
and then we fell to chatting.</p>

<p class='c001'>I gave him a message from a notable foreign ambassador
who was our mutual friend, and told him the reason I was in
Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“Ah! So you wish to see His Majesty, and also His
Excellency Tewfik Pasha! Well, I will see what can be
done,” was his reply.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But I want your Excellency to tell me, if you will, what
is the present situation in Turkey, and what are her future
aspirations?” I said boldly.</p>

<p class='c001'>The question was rather a poser. He hesitated. I pressed
him to tell me the truth as far as he was able, without being
injudicious; and at last, after some reluctance, he consented.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You Europeans,” he laughed, “are under a great misconception
as regards Turkey. My sovereign, His Imperial
Majesty, is often portrayed as a bloodthirsty brute, who
has no regard for human life, and whose reign is one of terror
and terrible injustice. Now the exact opposite is the truth.
You will meet His Majesty, and judge for yourself. I have
good opportunities of seeing how deeply he has the welfare
of his people at heart. Is it not he, for instance, who out of
his own pocket supports some six hundred schools in Turkey?
It is he, personally, who has more than once prevented a
declaration of war. I know we Turks have many defects.
But what nation has not? Even you English are not—well,
exactly perfect,” he laughed. “Foreigners come here to
Constantinople and hold up their hands that we do not sweep
our streets, as is done in other capitals. The fact is, Turkey
is not a rich country, and we have no money to expend on
scavengers. I and every Turk would only welcome cleanliness.
But how can we do it when we have no funds? Again,
the very people who criticise us, the foreigners, can come
and live here for twenty years and not pay one piastre of
municipal tax. Can they do that in any other country?”</p>

<p class='c001'>I admitted that they could not.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then why should they criticise us? All we want to
be allowed to do is to carry on our government in our own
way. Our population is of different race and different creed
from Europeans, and therefore necessitates a totally different
method of government. England does not understand
Turkey, or Turkish methods. I readily grant that our
government would not suit England, but neither would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>British ideas be tolerated here. For many years all the
diplomatic correspondence of the Sublime Porte has passed
through my hands, hence I know what I am speaking about
when on the topic of Turkish diplomacy. Abroad, we are
told that our word is not our bond, that we give promises
that we do not fulfil, and that we are a century or so behind
the times. Well, I admit that we are not a twentieth-century
nation. I admit that our Sublime Porte is not so imposing
as your Foreign Office in Whitehall, or the Ministère des
Affaires Étrangères in Paris, or in Vienna. But I do maintain
that the government of my sovereign, the Sultan, is a
beneficent one for Turkey, and that our foreign policy has
for its base the peace and welfare of the Balkans.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But Macedonia?” I remarked.</p>

<p class='c001'>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The question of Macedonia is, I admit, an extremely
difficult one,” he answered. “We have to govern a population
so varied, both in nationality and in creed, that there
must of necessity be constant aggressions and outbreaks.
It is said that we aid and abet the Greek bands in massacring
the Christians. I totally deny this. We do not. Surely
it is to our own interest to maintain peace and order in
Macedonia, and not to allow outsiders to create disorder
and dissension!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the protests of Bulgaria?”</p>

<p class='c001'>His Excellency smiled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We hear from time to time threats of war,” was his
answer. “But when we hear them, we remember that we are
sixteen million Turks; and when we sleep, we sleep quite
undisturbed by any war rumours from Sofia.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then you do not anticipate armed reprisals from
Bulgaria?”</p>

<p class='c001'>He laughed, but said nothing except—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Turkey is well informed, I assure you, of all that transpires
in Sofia.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Noury Pasha’s son, a smart lad of sixteen, entered and
chatted with us in French. He is going to Paris for his
education, and is destined for the Turkish Diplomatic Service.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>He is a bright, intelligent youth, who, like his father, is imbued
with Western ideas, and yet is naturally full of patriotism
for his own country.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another cup of excellent coffee, another cigarette over
a chat upon private matters, and I took leave of my host—after
I had begged the photograph which appears in these
pages—feeling that I had met one of the most charming and
most intelligent men in the great Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next day I called at the palace of Tewfik Pasha, and
on being ushered into a gorgeous reception-room—very
French, but by the way lit by candles in high glass chimneys—the
usual cup of coffee upon a golden tray and cigarette were
brought me. The secretary of the Greek Embassy was waiting
to see His Excellency upon an urgent matter concerning a
massacre by a Greek band in Macedonia which had taken place
near Seres the day previously. This meant, I saw, a long
interview, and not caring to wait, I left a message for His
Excellency to the effect that I would call and see him at
the Sublime Porte on the following morning.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next to His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, Tewfik Pasha
is certainly the most powerful man in the Ottoman Empire.
A quiet-mannered, quiet-spoken, grey-bearded gentleman
with kindly eyes and a fatherly manner, he is entirely the
opposite that one would expect of “the terrible Turk.” Born
in Constantinople in 1845, the son of a General of Division,
Ismail Hakki Pasha, he was destined for the army, and prosecuted
his studies with great diligence. Unfortunately,
owing to feeble health, he was compelled to abandon the
idea of a military career—not, however, before he had passed
his examination and obtained his diploma. He then chose
a new career, one in which he has certainly rendered his
country signal services. In 1866 he joined the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs as attaché, six years later being nominated
as second secretary at the Ottoman Legation at Rome,
whence he went to Vienna, to Berlin, and, later on, to Athens.
He was transferred to St. Petersburg as first secretary at
the moment when there arose those grave complications which
resulted in the war between Russia and Turkey. Then, during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>the war, he was appointed diplomatic agent to the Turkish
Commander-in-Chief. In 1879, after the war, he was sent
back to the Russian capital, but on this occasion in the
capacity of Minister Plenipotentiary.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the early age of forty-one Tewfik Pasha found himself
Ambassador at Berlin, a post which he occupied for ten years,
namely, till 1895. His personal charm, his uprightness, and
his frankness of manner endeared him to his colleagues in
the German capital, as well as to the German Court, and it was
he, indeed, who laid the foundation of the present cordial
friendliness between the sovereigns at Berlin and Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally, in 1895, the Sultan recalled him to Turkey and
promoted him to be Minister of Foreign Affairs, a powerful
position which he still holds. For the past eleven years he
has directed the destinies of the Ottoman Empire with broad-mindedness,
tact, and patience, that have, without doubt, been
highly beneficial to his country’s interests. His post is no
sinecure, as recent history has shown us. Yet he is a conscientious
man of Western ideas and Western views; one of
the cleverest diplomatists in the whole of Europe, and yet at
the same time just and honourable in his dealings. However
much we in England may criticise the policy of the Sublime
Porte, we can have only admiration for Tewfik Pasha, both as
a man and as the faithful servant of his Imperial master.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Turkey fresh diplomatic difficulties arise every minute,
yet with Noury Pasha’s assistance he grapples with them and
deals with them in a manner which the diplomatists of few
other nations could ever hope to do. Honoured by the most
complete confidence of his sovereign, who possesses for him a
particular esteem, Tewfik Pasha is universally known and
liked. The diplomatic corps in Constantinople are ever loud
in their praises of his extreme kindness and courtesy and his
readiness to accede to all requests that are in reason.</p>

<p class='c001'>His Excellency’s courtesy towards myself was very marked.
Hardly had I been ushered into his anteroom at the Sublime
Porte—a very shabby, unimposing building of long dreary
corridors with broken windows and broken wooden flooring—when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>the usual coffee was brought, and I signed his big visitors’
book. In that book I noticed the signatures of all the diplomatic
world of Constantinople. Then there entered the
Russian Ambassador, who, with a cheery “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Bon jour, m’sieur</i></span>,”
crossed, and also signed the book.</p>

<p class='c001'>A moment later the secretary came, and presenting His
Excellency’s regrets to the Ambassador, pointed out that he
already had an appointment with me, and asked whether he
would call later. The representative of the Tzar said he would
call the following morning, and I was then ushered into Tewfik’s
private room, a big, cheerful apartment with splendid Persian
carpets, long windows and a large writing-table at one end,
where sat the grey-bearded Minister in frock-coat and fez.
He rose and greeted me with a hearty hand-shake. With him
was seated the Grand Vizier and Noury Pasha, both of whom
also greeted me.</p>

<p class='c001'>We four had a long and very interesting conversation in
French, its drift, however, being such as would be injudicious
to print in these pages. The chat was of a purely private
character, although it closely concerned the present political
situation in the Near East.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The fact is,” remarked His Excellency presently, smiling
as he sat back in his arm-chair before his littered writing-table,
“we Turks are not understood abroad. Writers in
England, and especially your journalists, not knowing Turkey
and never having visited the East, criticise us, and say all
sorts of hard things about Turkish rule and Turkish diplomacy.
They call us intolerant and fanatical. But surely there are
evidences in Constantinople that we are tolerant? We allow
Christians to erect churches wherever they want them; and
again, have we not done everything possible in Macedonia to
preserve for its inhabitants their religious liberty? Really,
the English ought to know the truth concerning Turkey.
Unfortunately, the fashion of late seems to be to denounce our
land and all its ways!” And he laughed again.</p>

<p>In Constantinople.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I referred in guarded words to the possibilities of war with
Bulgaria, whereupon he said—</p>

<p class='c001'>“We view the matter with perfect tranquillity. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Government of His Imperial Majesty regrets most deeply
those unfortunate incidents in Macedonia that so constantly
occur, but is unable to remedy it. It is the Greek bands that
are to blame—not the Turks.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And your diplomatic relations with Bulgaria?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They are perfectly normal,” was his reply. “Dr.
Stancioff is an able Minister, and he fully understands us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then you do not anticipate hostilities at an early date?”
I asked, pressing home my question.</p>

<p class='c001'>His Excellency said nothing. He merely shrugged his
shoulders. But that gesture was, to me, sufficiently
significant.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are going to Macedonia,” he said. “It is not
altogether safe, you know, especially around Presba and Ochrida,
or about Seres. But if you <em>are</em> determined to go, I wish you
every good luck on your journey.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I thanked him, and after another half-hour’s pleasant
chat with the Grand Vizier and Noury Pasha I rose, and Tewfik
Pasha grasped my hand heartily in warm farewell, his parting
words being—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Go, see for yourself, and I believe you will find that we
Turks are not quite so black as we are painted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And I left the presence of a man whose broad-minded policy,
if it were adopted in every particular, would, I feel sure, advance
the Turkish cause, and place the Ottoman Empire in a very
different position from what it is to-day.</p>

<p class='c001'>I crossed the Sea of Marmora to Haidar Pasha, in Asia
Minor, visited Ismid, and saw the new German railway that
has its head opposite Stamboul and is to have its terminus
on the Persian Gulf. I went to Brusa, the ancient capital
of the Ottoman Empire, walked in the wonderful burying-grounds
of Scutari, and made many interesting excursions
about Asia Minor, in order to observe the all-powerful influence
of Germany in that country. And I was amazed.</p>

<p class='c001'>On my return to Constantinople I had other interviews
at the Yildiz with His Majesty himself, and with members of
the Government, all of which combined to show that Turkey
is not in any way afraid of Bulgaria. The fact is, she is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>uncertain of the attitude of Servia and Roumania, and is rather
mystified as to what Austria will do in the event of war. Relying
upon Germany, and treating Great Britain with studied
politeness, she views the present critical position with perfect
coolness and indifference.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, as Noury Pasha very justly said one day to me—</p>

<p class='c001'>“It takes a good deal to arouse us Turks, but when we
are aroused, we fight—and fight to the death.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Turkey to-day is still in its lethargic state, but once aroused,
who knows where the war will end, or what European complications
will result?</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER I <br /> PLAIN TRUTHS ABOUT MACEDONIA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>War imminent between Bulgaria and Turkey—My secret inquiries—Atrocities
by the Greek bands—Chats with the leaders of the insurrection—The
truth about the intrigues in Macedonia—I visit the scene of the massacres—Stories
told to me—Horrifying facts—Germany behind the assassins—A
disgraceful truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>This present record of my observations in the Near East
would be incomplete without some description of my
journey through Macedonia, and what I saw there.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Macedonian question is the burning question of to-day,
and one that can only be solved in one way—by a fierce and
bloody war.</p>

<p class='c001'>As I have already shown, there is every indication that
hostilities between Bulgaria and Turkey must occur in the
present year. Indeed, the thread is now strained to breaking
point, and one need never be surprised to learn at the breakfast-table
one morning that Bulgaria has boldly thrown down
the gauntlet to the Sultan. Then, aided by Roumania—who
will be induced to give her support in return for that additional
strip of territory between the Danube and the Black Sea, as
I have already indicated in a previous chapter—a fierce and
bitter struggle will commence. With Bulgaria, the Northern
Albanians will ally themselves according to the words of the
various chiefs of whom I made inquiry; Montenegro, and of
course Servia, will hold their own against the Turk, and the
result must be that the whole of the Balkans will be aflame.</p>

<p class='c001'>This forecast is no imaginary one. It is based upon
information imparted to me in confidence by Cabinet Ministers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>themselves—information which is in part in the possession of
the Foreign Office at this moment. Secret preparations are
in active progress both in Roumania and Bulgaria, while Servia
has ordered her new artillery to be delivered at the end of
this present spring. There is a tacit agreement between the
Balkan States that affairs in Macedonia are intolerable, and
that the decimated population must now be protected. And
in summary of the various conversations I had with the
monarchs and their Ministers in each of the Balkan capitals, I
can only say that the view is unanimous.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Servia, in Bulgaria, in Montenegro, in Albania, in
Roumania, and in Macedonia itself I made every inquiry from
reliable sources. From secret information, I was able to gather
that there is but one solution of the question—<span class='sc'>War</span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>At present the Bulgarian bands formed to protect the
Macedonians are passive. The organisation is still there,
and will be of greatest use when hostilities are declared; but
there is no activity, and there has, indeed, been little since
the recent abortive insurrection.</p>

<p class='c001'>Greek bands, aided and abetted by the Turks, are, however,
everywhere, and each day the most awful atrocities are committed
by them. Reports of these are received in Sofia and
in Constantinople, but no representation is made by either of
the Powers to the Sublime Porte or to Athens. “Macedonia!”
exclaimed a well-known foreign Ambassador one day, while I
was sitting at lunch with him at his Embassy, “Macedonia!
We’re sick of Macedonia, and have ceased to trouble about it!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ceased to trouble indeed! Here a great and intelligent
Christian population is being slaughtered in order to further
the ambitious aims of Germany, and no one stirs a finger!
Europe raised its eyes heavenward when it heard of the Congo
atrocities, yet of poor Macedonia the Powers are “sick,” and
she is cast helpless to the assassin’s knife!</p>

<p class='c001'>Before going to Macedonia I sought and obtained the
opinions of the leading authorities in the East, as well as
those of the rulers and Ministers. Much told me by the various
monarchs was, of course, in entire confidence, therefore I can
only speak generally in declaring their opinion to be in favour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>of securing for Macedonia autonomy under a European prince
as Governor-General.</p>

<p class='c001'>In more than one high quarter Prince Danilo of Montenegro
was mentioned as possible for the post, and in another the name
of Prince Mirko of Montenegro was put forward. A German
prince or an Austrian archduke would be impossible, but an
English prince would be welcomed, and the name of Prince
Arthur of Connaught was spoken of by more than one Balkan
Cabinet Minister.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Servia I had several highly interesting chats with
Professor Civics of Belgrade University, who is a well-known
authority on Macedonia, and who has recently published a book
attempting to prove that the bulk of the Macedonian population
is not Bulgar, but Serb. Many of his arguments I found, on
exhaustive inquiry, to be well based, yet my own conclusion is
that, after all, the great majority of the Macedonian population
is really Bulgar.</p>

<p class='c001'>This fact is admitted all through the Balkans, therefore
the situation in Macedonia must of necessity affect Bulgaria
more closely than any other nation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The question of Macedonia is a most difficult and complicated
one, but I spared no effort in order to thoroughly
master it in all its various phases, and to get at the truth of the
present and the probabilities of the near future.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Sofia I had a long talk with Professor Agoura of Sofia
University, who is one of the best-known authorities upon the
Macedonian question. He has been in Macedonia many
times, and, like myself, has had an opportunity of speaking
with the people and hearing their grievances.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In England the Macedonian question is entirely misunderstood,”
he said. “Some writers have taken Professor
Civics’ views, and endeavoured to prove that the Macedonians
are really Slavs. But they are not. Their whole history
shows that they are Bulgars.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the present state of the country?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never in the modern history of Macedonia has it been
in such a bad state as at present. The Christian Bulgars
are outraged, tortured, and shot, and their villages burnt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>by the Greek bands, who are now under the protection of the
Turks, and not a voice is raised at Constantinople in complaint.
It is simply astounding that such a state of things should
be allowed to exist in this twentieth century. Over one
thousand Christian Bulgars were killed in the raids last year,
and this year the number is known to be more than double.
Bulgaria is, however, at this moment staying her hand.
Weakened as the Macedonians are, and with Turkey protecting
the Greek bands, our Bulgarian bands for the protection
of the villages have but little chance. Of late, it has been
the unfortunate Bulgar who has lost always. The Bulgar
bands, it was found, compromised the villages, and at the
same time were not strong enough to protect them. Therefore
those still in Macedonia live in the mountains and come
down when required. Ah!” he added, throwing up his
hands, “the state of affairs is terrible! Only recently during
a village wedding at Zagoutcheni the place was attacked by
a Greek band and seventy men, women, and children killed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And in your opinion what would be the best settlement
of the question?” I inquired; for he was one of the greatest
authorities in Europe upon the much-vexed problem.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The best settlement of Macedonia would be an autonomy,
but a restrained one—one that would not separate Macedonia
from Turkey,” he replied. “Macedonia should be
placed under a European Governor-General—certainly not
German—preferably a Swiss. The police and the central
administration should be vested in the Governor-General,
and all other questions left to Turkey. Religion should,
of course, be free. Bulgaria has no desire to annex Macedonia,
as the Powers seem to think. I do not think that the
question can be settled in any other way. A European conference
should be convoked, and the matter dealt with at
once. When you go to Macedonia, you will see for yourself
the state of things. But remember, the Turks will let you
see nothing if they can help it. You are going to Monastir.
Good. Travel across to Ochrida, and you will see and hear
things that will appal you.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“Recently there have been, to my knowledge, eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Christian villages entirely destroyed by Greek bands—the
inhabitants exterminated, and the houses burned to the
ground. During the past two years there has never passed
one single day without murders and outrages committed by
Greek bands upon the Bulgar inhabitants of Macedonia.
Unfortunately, the Turkish army arrives always too late to
protect the population; but this is, of course, arranged: Indeed,
it seems as though the Turks protect these Greek bands and
assist them in their nefarious work. From Ochrida right
down to Salonica these murders are of daily occurrence,
always by the Greek bands. These bands operate in the
arrondissements of Seres, Drama, Demir-Hissar, Kavala; in
the Salonica <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayet</i></span> at Enije-Vardar, Vodena, and Guevgueli;
in Lerin, Florina, Castoria, Presba, and Murievo, and around
Monastir. The Servian bands operate at Cumanovo, Palanca,
Veles, Kitschevo, and Poretschi; while Turkish bands are
just now massacring at Tikveschi, Schlip, Veles, Kotschani,
Strousaitza, Razlog, Melnik, and Nevrokop. So it will be
seen that where there are no Greek bands, there are either
Turks or Servians.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In Sofia I also met the renowned leader of the premature
insurrection in Macedonia, General Ivan Tzontcheff, a short,
smart, dapper little man, quick of movement and alert of
manner. With him I likewise had a very interesting chat.
As one who has the Macedonian cause at heart, as head of the
Macedonian External Committee, and being in daily touch
with events in that terrified country, he and his friend, Monsieur
Gologanoff, were able to give me many details and explain
much that is unknown to the English public.</p>

<p class='c001'>I also met several times, and had long conversations with,
Dr. Tartarcheff, who was president of the Macedonian Revolutionary
Committee in Bulgaria, and who, after the insurrection,
was taken prisoner by the Turks. Both men
gave me much authentic information and introductions that
were of great use to me in my journey through Macedonia.</p>

<p class='c001'>The truth is that the Macedonian question is the direct
result of the Treaty of Berlin, for by it the Treaty of St. Stefano—which
incorporated Macedonia in the Bulgarian Principality—was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>annulled. The Treaty of Berlin thus left Macedonia
under the Turkish dominion, with a provision of a kind of
autonomy under the control of the Great Powers.</p>

<p class='c001'>This autonomy was worked up in detail by an International
Commission in Constantinople in 1880. But it was not
applied, and the situation in Macedonia remained the same
as it was before the Russo-Turkish War, and became even
worse, on account of the Turkish fanaticism aroused against
the Bulgarians as the cause of their military disasters.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Turkish persecutions and the new situation in Bulgaria
attracted the greater portion of the Macedonian intelligent
population into that Principality. A strong Macedonian emigration
was therefore started to Bulgaria, which in late years has
arisen to the number of more than 150,000.</p>

<p class='c001'>Macedonia, thus drained of its intelligence, devoted its
energies from 1880 to 1890 to a strong educational movement,
which was favoured in a great measure by the political circumstances
arisen after the union of Eastern Roumelia to the
Bulgarian Principality in 1885. Towards the end of this
period, 1880 to 1890, there had sprung up in Macedonia a
young, vigorous intelligence, with a strong national conscience,
longing for greater freedom in the national and economical
development of the country, and aspiring for a wider field of
activity. The Turks, afraid of the Bulgarian progress, began
to restrain the activity of the Macedonians. The growing
tyrannical régime of the Sultan Hamid made the situation
still more difficult, and life became impossible in the
country.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Macedonians then sought their salvation in revolution.</p>

<p class='c001'>This revolutionary movement had for its object the autonomy
of Macedonia, which is declared by all I met in the
Balkans to be the only solution of the question.</p>

<p class='c001'>Several important reasons are given for this. First, it is
argued that autonomy was secured by International Acts:—the
Treaty of Berlin, and the International Commission in
Constantinople, 1880. Secondly, it did not touch in any way
the integrity of the Turkish Empire, a dogma in the policy
of the European Powers. Thirdly, it did not in any way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>impair the suzerainty of the Sultan, who still remained the
sovereign of the province, and who had himself accepted and
signed the International Act. Fourthly, it gave full scope to
the free development of all the inhabitants in the country,
independently of religion or race. Fifthly, the autonomy not
only did not affect the interests of any Balkan State, but was
bringing a soothing element into the relations between the
Balkan nations.</p>

<p class='c001'>To-day the animosities between the Balkan nations have
their common cause in Macedonia. She is the apple of discord.
Every Balkan State is contemplating the conquest of this rich
province and the playing of principal rôle in the destinies of
the Peninsula. All have instituted church and school propagandas
in the country, where they wage a furious war
between themselves upon the shoulders of the native population.
This war is made more cruel by the policy of Turkey,
Germany, and Greece. So that in this way the Macedonian
population is demoralised, and the Balkan nations themselves
are exhausting their energy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The autonomy, if secured, would exercise a benign influence
towards an understanding between the Balkan nations. By
the establishment of such an administration in Macedonia,
under the guidance and the control of Europe, the Macedonians
would take their destiny in their own hands. The different
propagandas would not have such a propitious field for action,
and the animosities would gradually subside. That this is
the best solution of the Macedonian question is held by statesmen
all through the Peninsula, for by the progress of time
and the development of events the erection of Macedonia into
a separate state must become dominant as the final solution.</p>

<p class='c001'>The way for a Balkan Federation would then be cleared.
Macedonia by itself would become a kind of Switzerland, and
the nucleus towards the creation of a still more powerful
Switzerland in the Balkan Federation, which, neutralised,
would create in the Balkan Peninsula a field for progress
and civilisation, but not a bridge for the conquering ambitions
from the North.</p>

<p class='c001'>With such broad ideas and with such hopes, the Macedonians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>wrote upon their revolutionary banner the watchwords,
“<em>Macedonia for the Macedonians</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The revolutionary movement in Macedonia—which dates
from the year 1893—began to develop into a strong organisation
from 1896-97. The whole country, by patient work,
was gradually covered with a network of secret societies, at the
head of which was a Central Revolutionary Committee, which,
in fact, had a greater power in the country than the official
Turkish authorities.</p>

<p class='c001'>This revolutionary organisation had an international
character. In it were received all the Macedonians thirsting
for liberty. In its ranks were not only Bulgarians, but
also Vlachs, Montenegrins, Servians, and even Turks, discontented
with the Sultan’s régime. But on the whole, the
organisation bore a Bulgarian colour, chiefly on account of the
great Bulgarian majority in Macedonia, and also on account
of the suspicion that the organisation intended prosecuting
Bulgarian ambitions.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the reason that Macedonia had a population mostly
of Bulgarian nationality, and through the agitation of
Macedonian Emigration, the revolutionary movement found a
favourable ground in Bulgaria. Here it was met with sympathy,
which was followed by moral and material support. An
organisation was instituted in the Principality, which spread
its influence very rapidly through the whole country. This
organisation was called the External Organisation, while that
in Macedonia bore the name of the Internal Revolutionary
Organisation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The activity of these two organisations brought the revolutionary
movement to a great development during the years
of 1900 and 1901. The revolutionary idea became dominant
in Macedonia. Nearly the whole population was united in a
strongly organised body, and a great part of the men able to
fight were armed, and fighting bands were formed which exercised
the armed men. The country was divided into military
districts, and the Macedonians were inspired with such enthusiasm
that they welcomed, with a thrill of exultation, the
impending struggle. The enthusiasm was no less great in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Bulgaria, where the coming insurrection was awaited with
great hopes of success. Indeed, no nation in the Balkan
Peninsula had shown such a power of organisation, such
sacrificing spirit, and such fighting qualities as the Macedonians.
An intimate knowledge of the Macedonian revolutionary
movement, such as General Tzontcheff possesses, shows, indeed,
the wonderful energy of the Macedonians.</p>

<div id='i292'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_292fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>A Bulgarian Band in Macedonia.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But alas! political intrigues from quarters with unfriendly
dispositions towards Macedonian aspirations, sowed misunderstandings
in the midst of the Organisation, and her
forces were suddenly paralysed by internal strife just on the
eve of the struggle.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consequence was that the Macedonian revolutionary
movement did not express itself in one general effort, but in
partial insurrections, none of which showed the whole revolutionary
energy. The insurrection in the valley of the river
Stromina during the autumn of 1902 and the insurrection in
the <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayet</i></span> of Monastir in 1903 were easily crushed, and the
hopes and expectations of the population unfortunately
deceived.</p>

<p class='c001'>After these abortive insurrections a new situation was
created. The European Powers admitted the inability of the
Turkish Government to establish order in Macedonia, and
the principle of European interference and control was adopted.
As a result of this principle, the Murshteg reforms worked
up by Austria and Russia were proclaimed. These reforms,
however, were not integral, but merely embryo reforms, from
the expansion and development of which depended the pacification
of the country.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, the morale of the Macedonians was
now shaken and the power of the Revolutionary Organisation
shattered in consequence of the incomplete insurrections
and the consequent Turkish victories.</p>

<p class='c001'>Naturally, the Turks, faithful to their traditional policy,
would avail themselves of this situation in order to hinder
the development of the reforms in their true sense. The
Greeks—whose policy is the partition of Macedonia—were, like
the Turks, against such a development of the reforms, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>the establishment of an effectual European control would
lead to a good government, which would gradually evolve
the destiny of Macedonia towards an autonomy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Therefore, the policy of Turkey, Greece, and Germany
had a common interest, namely, to paralyse the reforms, and
became a common enemy to the Macedonians, who, by their
Bulgarian majority, were striving for autonomy.</p>

<p class='c001'>So, united in their action, Greece, and also Servia to a
smaller extent, hurled, the one from the South and the other
from the North, armed bands into Macedonia, who commenced
their destructive work against the Bulgarian element, by
killing the leading men and enforcing the country population
to recognise Greek or Servian nationality. The Turks cover
their action, and the villagers, unprotected and without arms,
are unable to defend themselves. They are at the mercy of
these bands, aided by the Turkish authorities.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus a cruel religious and racial war has sprung up in the
heart of Macedonia, under the protection and instigation of
the Turkish policy, and also under the benevolent eyes of
Germany and Austria.</p>

<p class='c001'>This terrible situation has been still more complicated
by the Bulgarians themselves. The Revolutionary Organisation
being shattered in its moral and material power, armed
bands were formed after the insurrection, under unscrupulous
leaders, who commenced acts of depredation upon the unfortunate
Macedonians.</p>

<p class='c001'>Just now the revolutionary organisation in Bulgaria is undergoing
another crisis. It is divided into two principal flanks:
the moderate and the extreme. The first-mentioned inclines
towards a suspension of active revolutionary operations on
account of the exhaustion of the <a id='corr294.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Macedonion'>Macedonian</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_294.31'><ins class='correction' title='Macedonion'>Macedonian</ins></a></span> population and
the unfavourable political situation in Europe, while the
extreme party are urging a continuance of revolutionary action
to exasperation. At the annual congress in January last the
moderates had a chance to oust the extreme party, but the
death of Damian Groueff, the chief of the moderates, who was
killed in the village of Roussinovo (<span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayet</i></span> of Uskub) upset
all their plans. On account of Groueff’s death they did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>not take part in the congress, and the result is that the
extreme party are now all paramount, and further reprisals
may be expected.</p>

<p class='c001'>Therefore from all sides—from Turks, Greeks, Servians,
and even Bulgarians, as well as from an interested diplomacy—the
Macedonians are pressed, and their aspirations for the
autonomy compromised. And what is the result of all this?
Only that the Macedonians are set by the interested Powers
before the eyes of the Christian world as a cruel and barbarous
population, unworthy of sympathy—worthy only of the
tyrannical Turkish rule!</p>

<p class='c001'>What is the remedy?</p>

<p class='c001'>There is but one, the one advocated by the kings and
princes of the Balkans and the Cabinet Ministers with whom
I chatted, namely, to change the present farcical so-called
reforms into an administration, under effectual European
control by appointing a European Governor-General, responsible
to the Powers. Then this terrible situation will change
into the peaceful development of a country which is endowed
by nature with bounty, but reduced by men’s covetousness to
a perfect hell.</p>

<p class='c001'>That Macedonia to-day is a hell I have seen with my own
eyes. And moreover I have been under fire from a Greek
band myself. I travelled—contrary to the advice of my
friends, who feared the perils of the way—right through the
heart of Macedonia from south to north, visiting the Seres and
Melnik districts, which only a few days prior to my arrival
had been ravaged by Greek bands. In one poor village I
passed through, twenty-three women, children, and old men
had been butchered in cold blood on the previous day, and
I saw with my own eyes some of their mutilated bodies.
Upon the women nameless atrocities had been committed.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Caraja-Kioi, a village not far from Seres, I was told
that a fortnight before, nineteen persons, mostly old men and
women, had been massacred, and I was informed by eye-witnesses
that the Greek band was assisted by the Turks, and
that present at the massacre was a Greek metropolitan and
a Greek consular employé!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>I saw and spoke to two women who had been maltreated
by the Greeks, and who still bore wounds. The head of one
was bound by a bloodstained rag, and the arm of the other
was in a sling.</p>

<p class='c001'>What they told me was truly horrifying. Both had been
outraged and left for dead, without a hand being raised in
their defence. And their cases were only two out of several
dozen. A child, a little girl of seven, had been decapitated
by a brutal Turk, and a mother with her suckling babe had
been tortured by slow burning.</p>

<p class='c001'>Everywhere I went was the same terrible tale, the same
cry for the protection of the Powers. At Vranja, in the Melnik
district, I saw the gaunt ruins of seven houses which had been
recently burnt, and was told how nine women, after being
subjected to all sorts of atrocities, were afterwards shot, while
at Bashna three men were burnt alive, in a house, and six
women shot.</p>

<p class='c001'>That journey through Macedonia still haunts me like a
nightmare. On the one hand, I met the oily Turkish official
in frock-coat and fez declaring that the country was quite
quiet, and that all reports were exaggerated; while, on the
other, I saw with my own eyes the devilish blood-lust of the
Greeks, the poor people with their wounds still upon them,
the mutilated bodies of innocent Christian women whose
blood calls hourly for vengeance.</p>

<p class='c001'>To Florina, up to Kastoria, and through the terrorised
districts around the lakes of Presba and Ochrida I travelled,
first under Turkish escort, but not being allowed to see what I
wanted, I was permitted by a Bulgarian band to join them, and
rode through the various districts. It was a somewhat perilous
and exciting time, for I travelled quickly, wishing to get out
of the country. Its terrors had got on my nerves, and the
gloomy warnings of my friends ever rose within my mind.
Greek bands seemed to be operating everywhere, and we never
knew when we might not come into close quarters. Our way
lay often through deep ravines, affording excellent cover for
lurking Greeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>So life was the reverse of pleasant.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Still I saw with my own eyes sights that appalled me,
and I am certain that if the reader had seen what I have
witnessed he would cry shame that such an awful state of
things should be allowed to exist, and even fostered by a
Christian civilised Power.</p>

<p class='c001'>Does the Christian Kaiser, with all his outward declarations
of belief in the direction of the Almighty, ever give a
thought to the poor Macedonians butchered with his knowledge—butchered
to further the secret aims of the “Fatherland”?
Does His Imperial Majesty, when he bends his
knee in prayer, remember the first tenets of the Christian
faith?</p>

<p class='c001'>Those who know, as I know, the secrets of German intrigue
in Constantinople, cannot but feel contempt and disgust at
the shameful sacrifice of human life in Macedonia, where Greeks
and Turks outrage, torture, burn, and shoot the poor innocent
populace, egged on by “pious” Germany.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let the ambitious Emperor, who so often invokes God’s
blessing upon the German nation, pause for a moment and reflect
whether there is no hypocrisy in his political policy, and whether
he himself, personally, can expect to receive the Divine aid he
so constantly petitions with mock servility.</p>

<p class='c001'>By raising his hand he could to-morrow stop those brutal,
savage Greeks from their bloody work. Yet, by doing so, he
knows he would nullify his policy of Germany’s advance
southward, and would throw to the winds the years of secret
diplomacy practised at the Sublime Porte. Will he do
so?</p>

<p class='c001'>Or will he continue to lift his eyes to Heaven, and close
his ears to the death-cries of the poor slaughtered Christian
women and children, who are every day being butchered
for political purposes?</p>

<p class='c001'>It was the Kaiser’s diplomacy that discovered the existence
of the Roumanian population in Macedonia; it was by his
intrigues at Athens that diplomatic negotiations between Greece
and Roumania have been broken off.</p>

<p class='c001'>Go to Macedonia yourself with an open mind and study
the question on the spot, and you will, before a week has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>passed, obtain quite sufficient evidence to convince you that
what I have here written is the truth—that Germany stands
behind both Greek and Turk, and encourages them with
moral and material support to commit those awful and nameless
outrages which are a disgrace to our civilisation.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER II <br /> THE TRUTH EXPOSED</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Summary of my confidential information—War this year—The attitude of
Greece, Bulgaria, Roumania, and Turkey—Procrastination, promises,
and perfect politeness—A matter more serious than Macedonia—Warning
to British statesmen and the public—The real truth exposed—Germany
and India.</p>

<p class='c007'>As summary of all my confidential inquiries throughout
the Near East, I find that the present position as regards
Macedonia is a very serious one.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bulgaria, who has the largest population there, has undoubtedly
decided to adopt a firm course, which must inevitably
lead to war during the present year. Within a few months
the Balkans will be in bloody conflict.</p>

<p class='c001'>Greece is defiant, and her bands still ravage Macedonia.
Monsieur Theotokis, the Prime Minister, has openly adopted
a policy of defiance against Roumania, and of increased persecution
of the Vlachs in Macedonia.</p>

<p class='c001'>His attitude is a ridiculous one, and calculated to still
further complicate the situation. He declares that the enemies
of Hellenism have succeeded in persuading public opinion in
Europe, and even European Governments, that the abnormal
situation in Macedonia is due to the action of Greco-Macedonian
bands, and has also made them forget the atrocities which
Bulgarians had committed for six years against the Greeks,
who had at last been compelled to rise and try to defend themselves.
Whenever the Greek Government asks for compensation
of the Powers, no matter what the question at issue, they
are, he says, met with the argument that they were responsible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>for the atrocities in Macedonia, because they aided Greek bands.
The Powers, he says, were informed that the Hellenic Government
could not prevent succour being given to the Macedonian
Greeks in their defensive campaign, but would use its authority
to moderate the activity of the bands. Unhappily, the slackening
of the activity of the Greek bands was followed by a
recrudescence of that of the hostile bands. The Powers were
informed that the situation was becoming intolerable, and
unless they could take measures to oblige others to respect
their wishes, the Greek Government would be obliged to
defend a race which was resolved to live, and not to bend under
the ferocity of its enemies. He maintains that it is the duty
of Greece to accelerate her military preparations. Without
an army she cannot be considered a factor in the East, or hope
for the sympathies of others.</p>

<p class='c001'>But M. Theotokis has gone even farther. His declarations
are distinctly amusing. In the course of an interview in Athens
in January of the present year he actually had the audacity to
attribute the present situation in Macedonia to Bulgaria. He
argued as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“For a period of six years armed bands of Bulgarians
roved all over Macedonia, endeavouring to get the Greek
Christian inhabitants to declare allegiance to the head of
the Bulgarian Church, and backed up their efforts in this
direction by committing murders and atrocities of every
description. Notwithstanding repeated appeals of the
Greek Government to the Powers to put a stop to these
outrages, they were continued, and instead of being
checked, went on increasing in number and violence.
News of these atrocities reaching Greece daily, public
opinion here was getting more and more excited,
and finally, the Greek public having given up all hope of
a stop being put to them, committees were formed with
the object of taking action to protect their compatriots.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Greek Government was powerless to prevent
these protective bands from crossing into Macedonia, as,
unfortunately, we have not sufficient forces to thoroughly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>guard the frontier. The inability is not surprising,
when you consider that Turkey with twenty times the
forces at her disposal is not able to prevent them from
getting across. That these bands should occasionally
have seized an opportunity to avenge Bulgarian crimes,
which had continued so long unrestrained, is only natural,
as it is not possible to keep armed bands under proper
control in such circumstances.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Finding at last that they had to face Greek bands, which
they were not able to stand up against, the Bulgarians commenced
to fill the world with complaints against the
Greeks, and sent out descriptions of imaginary atrocities
committed by Greek bands, when their only real cause of
complaint was that they themselves could no longer
commit crimes on the Greek Christians with impunity in
the way they, for six years, had been accustomed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The result of the great outcry raised by the Bulgarians
was that strong pressure was brought to bear by the
Powers on the Greek Government to prevent Greek bands
from crossing into Macedonia, and the Greek Government
increased the efforts they had always been making
in this direction. Probably as a result of the efforts of
this Government, fewer Greek bands have been operating
in Macedonia during the past two months, and the consequence
is that thirty-nine Greeks have been murdered
in Macedonia during this period by Bulgarians, while
only seven of the latter have been killed by Greeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Greek Government have no interest whatever in
hindering the efforts of the Powers to restore order in
Macedonia. Quite the contrary; no one desires to see
order restored there more than we do. But you must
remember that the majority of the inhabitants of Macedonia
are Greeks, and it is not in the power of the Greek
Government to control public opinion in Greece in face of
the atrocities committed by Bulgarians on our countrymen
in Macedonia. If the Bulgarian propaganda in that
country is put a stop to, the Greek Christians will have
nothing to fear, and in such circumstances no Greek bands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>will be found there, as their sole object in crossing the
frontier was to protect their co-religionists, who for six
years had been terrorised by the Bulgarians. Once
Bulgarian crimes in Macedonia cease, there will be nothing
more heard of ‘regrettable incidents’ in that country.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Thus it will be seen that the Prime Minister makes no
mention of Germany or of German intrigue. He endeavours
to put the blame upon Bulgaria, when all Europe knows well
that it is Greece who is responsible for the present bloodshed,
and even the Turkish Grand Vizier himself has condemned the
action of the Greeks, and declared that in more than one instance
the Greek bands have actually operated with the full knowledge
and assistance of Greek consuls.</p>

<p class='c001'>With such biassed views held by the Greek Premier, it can
easily be seen that a solution of the problem of Macedonia
cannot be arrived at without recourse to force of arms, and
the more so, because of Bulgaria’s determination to make her
power felt in the country where her subjects are being daily
murdered.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Turkish policy is the traditional one of procrastination,
promises, and perfect politeness. The promised reforms are
not carried out, the foreign officers employed in reforming
the gendarmerie are disgusted with their treatment, and are
fast leaving the Turkish service, while the Mohammedan rule
is daily growing more and more oppressive, and the unfortunate
Macedonians are being slaughtered under the very
eyes and with the full cognisance of the Turkish officials,
both civil and military.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Constantinople it is believed that a serious <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>entente</i></span>
regarding Macedonia exists between Italy and Austria, and
this belief is based upon Signor Tittoni’s recent declaration.
From information I gathered from very reliable sources,
however, I am in a position to state that the Turkish fears
are utterly groundless. An <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>entente</i></span> exists, but only in regard
to Servia, Bulgaria, and Northern Albania. Austria desired
that Montenegro should be included, but Italy—for very
obvious reasons—made the complete independence of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>valiant little country one of the stipulations. Hitherto Italy
and Austria have carried on separate propagandas, but it is
quite certain that the two are now amalgamated, and will in
future work towards one common end.</p>

<p class='c001'>Turkey has nothing to fear from either Austria or Italy,
but from Bulgaria and Germany—from the former, who will
assert her rights; and from the latter, who will eventually
play the traitor and crush her.</p>

<p class='c001'>My conversations at the Sublime Porte, in those shabbily
furnished rooms, with seedy officials offering me cups of coffee,
were often very amusing. I had really credited the Turk with
more shrewdness, for the Oriental is usually supposed to be the
finest diplomat in all the world. Yet from the Grand Vizier
downwards to the men-in-the-street, they are all held
fascinated under the benign smile of Germany.</p>

<p class='c001'>Assurances were given me during those audiences with
the rulers of Turkey that all was being done that could possibly
be done in Macedonia; that reports of massacres were exaggerated;
that the Turks were actually protecting the Bulgarians,
and that the Macedonian question was not at all a serious
one.</p>

<p class='c001'>I will give one instance. It was admitted to me during
one of my audiences at the Sublime Porte, that “a few incidents”
had occurred, but I was assured that they were not
serious, and that all was now quiet in Macedonia.</p>

<p class='c001'>In reply, I pointed out that on November 7 last (Old
Style) a Greek band descended upon the village of Karadjovo,
and having disembowelled seven men, killed twenty-five
Bulgarians. They then massacred most of the women and
children in the village, and calmly went off.</p>

<p class='c001'>I was then officially informed that it had been discovered
that a certain Greek consul had been implicated in this raid,
and that arms had been supplied through him. The Turks
had therefore made a strong protest to Athens, and sent four
battalions in pursuit of the assassins.</p>

<p class='c001'>At Salonica, ten days later, I saw one of the peasants
present at this massacre in question, and the description he
gave of it was horrifying. His version of the affair was very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>different from the official Turkish version, for he declared that
the Turks themselves aided the assassins and allowed them
to get clear away. Twenty-five women were, he said, outraged
and afterwards killed. One woman had her hands cut off,
and another’s feet were burnt over a fire. Other facts he told
me were too terrible to repeat here.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though the Porte may have made formal protest to Athens,
there is but little doubt that the Turks were implicated in
the massacre—as they are in most of those “regrettable
incidents,” as they are called, which daily occur in the Land
of Black Terror.</p>

<p class='c001'>Permission was readily granted to me to travel through
the country, but it certainly would not have been had it been
known that beyond the lake of Ochrida I intended to disregard
my Turkish escort and throw in my lot with the Bulgarians,
declared by the authorities to be “insurgents” in order to
see for myself.</p>

<p class='c001'>I arrived at the village of Ghilposte, in the Seres district,
two days after a Greek band had descended upon the little
place, and I saw with my own eyes traces of their terrible
atrocities. They had blown up ten houses by dynamite, and
capturing four men, two women, and a baby one year old,
had deliberately burned them all alive, as well as outraging
three other women.</p>

<p class='c001'>The leader of the Bulgarian organisation for the protection
of the defenceless people furnished me with a complete list
of all the atrocities committed by the Greek bands during
the past year, but it is so long and the details are so revolting
that I do not feel justified in including it in these pages.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Turk is indeed a strange product. He hopes always
to persuade the foreigner into adopting his own views. More
than once I was told in Constantinople that there had been
<em>no massacres</em> in Macedonia this year, and that the country,
especially in the <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>vilayet</i></span> of Monastir, was quite quiet!</p>

<p>The Turkish Burial-ground at Scutari, Asia Minor.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I went there, and discovered the exact opposite to be
the case. In Constantinople also I was strongly persuaded,
by interested persons, not to go to Macedonia; but I went,
and I saw things that it was not intended that I should see.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>I had travelled all through the Balkans in order to learn
the real truth, and I did not intend to miss out Macedonia.
Turkey, of course, makes capital out of the fact that the
Vlachs, or Roumanian population, are between the devil
and the deep sea. These unfortunate Macedo-Roumanians
live under the cross fire of Greek and Bulgar, each of whom
claims the right to save their souls. The Turks point—and
perhaps justly—to this fact as one of the chief causes of the
present disturbed state of Macedonia. The Turk pretends
to be asleep, and to disregard the intrigues of the other Powers,
but the fact is that he is very wide awake, and knows quite
well that hostilities must break out at a very early date.
Only he is misled by Germany, alarmed by a bogey put forward
by Austria and Italy, and a little afraid, at times, of British
protests.</p>

<p class='c001'>There remains Roumania. Her attitude is a very serious
consideration in discussing the immediate future of the Balkans.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Bucharest I found that, although a Federation of the
Balkan States would be welcomed, yet one fact is still remembered.
In 1888, when the Bulgarians offered the crown
of Bulgaria to King Charles of Roumania, as the first step
towards a Federation, both Russia and Austria opposed it so
strongly that the King was unable to accept. Roumania’s
position towards Macedonia is now one of armed inactivity.
Though the Macedo-Roumanians are slaughtered by the Greek
bands, Roumania is compelled to stay her hand and offer no
defence, because alone and unaided, her protest would be
worse than useless.</p>

<p class='c001'>That she will, ere long, ally herself with Bulgaria against
the Turks, my confidential information goes to show. She
desires a better frontier from the Danube to the Black Sea,
and in order to obtain that concession from Bulgaria she
will assist her to drive the Turk from Macedonia.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, however, a far more serious consideration, and
one which has been overlooked by British statesmen and the
British public.</p>

<p class='c001'>During my journey of inquiry I made careful investigation
into certain suspicious facts and certain clever intrigues. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>inquiry was an exceedingly difficult one, for the truth is well
guarded, for very obvious reasons.</p>

<p class='c001'>The result, however, reveals a state of affairs of which
we in England have been unfortunately ignorant, and which,
here exposed, should claim immediate attention by every right-minded
and patriotic man.</p>

<p class='c001'>The truth briefly is this. The recent war between Russia
and Japan, the question of Morocco, the perturbation in Europe
by the Russian defeats and revolution, on the one hand, and the
weakness of the Macedonians made greater by the rivalries
between the Balkan nations, on the other, have of late
diverted the attention of Europe from the Near East.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this is only a lull before the storm—a storm that must
break in the near future, and which surely will have a world-wide
significance. The countries denominated by the general
name of the Near East are, by their geographical position and
fertility, of immense importance. They have been the cradle
of the ancient civilisation and of rich and powerful empires.
The shores of the Ægean Sea and of the Eastern Mediterranean
were once the most populated, and their commerce and wealth
were unrivalled. The vast fertile provinces of Asia Minor
have been the granaries of the Roman and Byzantine empires;
while the valleys of Euphrates and Tigris breathed abundance
and luxury. History is eloquent testimony of their past
splendour. The reason of their gloomy present does not lie
either in the exhaustion of the soil or in the loss of their geographical
importance, but only in the administration which
the Turk has established for centuries over them. A change
in the administration will bring resurrection. Nay, the means
and resources of the present civilisation must call forth in
them an immense economical development.</p>

<p class='c001'>Germany, with her usual foresight, has ever been on the
alert.</p>

<p class='c001'>Towards this Near East with gloomy present, but with a
glorious future, the German policy has thrown covetous eyes.
When Bismarck made his famous declaration—<em>that the Eastern
Question was not worth the bones of a Pomeranian grenadier</em>—the
German policy was already maturing a vast plan of penetration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>in the Near East. The real truth is that the basis of this
policy of penetration was the maintenance of the Turkish
rule, as a means for its realisation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The true extent of German intrigue is not realised in
England, therefore I may as well explain that the policy was—</p>

<p class='c001'>1. Support, and even encouragement, of the despotical
régime in Turkey, in order to obtain the absolute confidence
of Sultan Hamid.</p>

<p class='c001'>2. Grasp of the reorganisation of the Turkish Army, and
use it as her instrument.</p>

<p class='c001'>3. Gain a dominant position in the Turkish finances.</p>

<p class='c001'>4. Lay hold on the communications of the empire, and
thus become the master of her economical development.</p>

<p class='c001'>A full expansion was given to this policy after the accession
to the throne of William <span class='fss'>II.</span>, who in his first visit to the Sultan
in 1889 laid the foundation of mutual friendship and admiration
between the two rulers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The results are astonishing. In less than a quarter of a
century the German net has been cast over the whole body
of the Turkish Empire. German diplomacy is paramount
to-day in Constantinople. The Turkish Army has been
reorganised upon the Prussian system, and is under German
control. The finances of the Turkish Empire are gradually
becoming a dependency to the German banks by loans and
concessions, which are constantly increasing. By the great
railway from the Bosphorus to the Persian Gulf, opening up
by its branches the most fertile provinces of Asiatic Turkey,
Germany becomes master of the economical development of
this part of the Sultan’s empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the economical and political influence of the Germans
has been so much extended and has gained such a domination,
that the Turkish Empire is, in a sense, already a German
protectorate. No act of importance is possible in Turkey
without the knowledge and influence of Germany. Every
act of Abdul Hamid is under the control and direction of
German diplomacy. <span lang="tr" xml:lang="tr"><i>Allemania bisum dostour</i></span> (“Germany is
our friend”) is a saying which has penetrated even into the
mass of the Turkish nation, and the Kaiser has a full right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>to boast himself as the protector and champion of the
Mussulmans.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Balkan Peninsula, on the European side, the pioneer
of the German policy is the Austro-Hungarian Empire. By
tradition, by its dynasty, and by its alliance, Austria plays
the rôle of vanguard to the German advance towards the
Near East. The occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has
made Austria a Balkan power, and her plans are ready for
the march of an Austrian army southward to the Gulf of
Salonica, which will bring her in touch with the Ægean Sea
and make her the ruler over the whole Peninsula. In the
meantime, she is strengthening her political and economical
influence in Servia and Albania by the same methods as used
by the Germans.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the midst of this land activity in the Near East, the
importance of the Ægean Sea, which is the necessary link,
was not lost to view. A footing was sought, and the island
of Thassos was chosen as the foundation-stone of the future
naval power in the Eastern basin of the Mediterranean. This
island was picked upon because, in the first place, it would not
attract attention, and, in the second place, because it would
serve admirably the German plans. Thassos has a good
geographical position in the Ægean Sea. It is not far from
the Dardanelles, the door to Constantinople, and is very near
the Macedonian shore, being in the very entrance of the port
of Kavala.</p>

<p class='c001'>With a naval base on this island, Germany would gain a
still greater influence in Turkey, and especially on the European
and Asiatic shores of the Ægean Sea. According to trustworthy
information which I have obtained in confidence, a
vast German activity is contemplated upon these shores in
the very near future.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the Germans, with the aid of the Turkish régime
and of the Austrian Empire, are cleverly paving their way
towards the Near East, and preparing the foundation of a
“Fatherland” stretching from the Baltic to the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Germany has already championed the cause of Turkey
in Europe, what is to prevent her from carrying her influence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>at an early date, over Egypt and the whole peninsula of India,
where she will find sixty millions of Mussulmans, who fully
recognise that England has abandoned her policy of bolstering
up “the sick man” for many years past? These latter would
welcome Germany as the champion of Mohammedanism, not
only in Europe, but in all the Mussulman states of the Eastern
world.</p>

<p class='c001'>And then?</p>

<p class='c001'>Surely this is a most important point, which should very
seriously engage the immediate and earnest attention of all
British statesmen who have the true interests of our Empire at
heart!</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
